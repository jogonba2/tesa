But, the algorithm I written for computing the \"lowest common ancestors\" seem to work also for cyclic graphs because basically what it does is: to compute the ancestors of each entity (Dijkstra), intersect the ancestors and sort them by the sum of distances. I don't know why this is supposed not to work for cyclic graphs. \n",

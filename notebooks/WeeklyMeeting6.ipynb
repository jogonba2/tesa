J&J is one of the world's most valuable companies. Boston Scientific, With Abbott's Help, Raises Bid for Guidant: Boston Scientific, with financial help from Abbott Laboratories, offers$ 27 billion for Guidant . Guidant switches its support from Johnson& Johnson 's merger proposal in favor of Boston Scientific. Further offer from Johnson& Johnson seems less likely after it suggests that deal between Guidant and Boston Scientific would greatly reduce earnings of merged company.

Airbus is registered in the Netherlands; its shares are traded in Germany, France and Spain. It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures aircraft in the European Union and various other countries. The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2017 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Airbus Hopes Its Planes, Not Its Setbacks, Will Stand Out: In July 2006, they unveiled the redesigned A350-XWB, with a wider fuselage, better fuel economy and more passenger comfort. Yet by the time the parent company of Airbus , European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company , gave Airbus the permission to market the new version of the plane in December, Boeing had secured nearly 450 orders for the competing 787, a number that has since risen to 584.

      "The United States Department of State , commonly referred to as the State Department, is a federal executive department responsible for carrying out U.S. foreign policy and international relations. Established in 1789 as the nation's first executive department, its duties include advising the President of the United States, administering the nation's diplomatic missions, negotiating treaties and agreements with foreign entities, and representing the U.S. at the United Nations. The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States. It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law, and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, including suits between two or more states and those involving ambassadors. The Court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution. Supreme Court Refuses Case Challenging Group's Designation as Terrorists: The Supreme Court refused on Monday to intervene in the federal prosecution of seven Iranian refugees for providing financial support to an opposition group in Iran that the State Department has designated as a terrorist organization. The seven defendants, who are now all United States citizens, argue that they are constitutionally entitled to challenge the validity of that designation as part of their defense.

Boeing stock is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Airbus Hopes Its Planes, Not Its Setbacks, Will Stand Out: In July 2006, they unveiled the redesigned A350-XWB, with a wider fuselage, better fuel economy and more passenger comfort. Yet by the time the parent company of Airbus , European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company , gave Airbus the permission to market the new version of the plane in December, Boeing had secured nearly 450 orders for the competing 787, a number that has since risen to 584.

The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States. It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law, and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, including suits between two or more states and those involving ambassadors. The Court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution. Supreme Court Refuses Case Challenging Group's Designation as Terrorists: The Supreme Court refused on Monday to intervene in the federal prosecution of seven Iranian refugees for providing financial support to an opposition group in Iran that the State Department has designated as a terrorist organization. The seven defendants, who are now all United States citizens, argue that they are constitutionally entitled to challenge the validity of that designation as part of their defense.

      "Dmitri Alekseyevich Medvedev is a Russian football midfielder. Sergei Borisovich Ivanov is a Russian senior official and politician who is the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation on the Issues of Environmental Activities, Environment and Transport since 12 August 2016. Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the President of Russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 until 2008. In between his presidential terms, he was also the Prime Minister of Russia under president Dmitry Medvedev. Post-Putin: Announcing one 's own candidacy is, in fact, tantamount to declaring one 's open opposition to the Kremlin, to the smooth transition of power, to Putin himself . Even the parliamentary opposition is wary of doing that. So far in this quasi-election season only two people have done it: a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and, improbably, Aleksandr V. Donskoi , the youthful mayor of Arkhangelsk, a small port city on the White Sea. Both promptly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors, even as the mass media piled on in the way they never do with today 's authorities, certainly not the likes of Putin , Ivanov or Medvedev .

      "William Jefferson Clinton is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Joseph Isadore Lieberman is an American politician, lobbyist and attorney who served as a United States Senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 election. During his final term in office he was officially listed as an independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party. Edward Miner Lamont Jr. is an American businessman and politician serving as the 89th governor of Connecticut since January 9, 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a Greenwich selectman from 1987 to 1989. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006, defeating incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman in the state Democratic primary election. Lamont Criticizes Lieberman's 1998 Rebuke of Clinton Over Affair: Senator Lieberman said what he believed. And many people believe that by making the statement he did, and separating the moral ramifications from any legal questions he helped defuse the case for impeachment to protect President Clinton 's presidency.'' As the two Senate candidates returned to Connecticut from Washington on Thursday, Mr. Lamont unveiled a new campaign commercial featuring a young man reading the names of several soldiers who were killed in the war in Iraq.

      "Barack Hussein Obama II ; born August 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Clinton Camp Challenges Obama on Iraq: Yet when it came later to hypothetical questioning about how he would have voted on the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Mr. Obama has been more circumspect. With the war a central issue in the campaign and with part of Mr. Obama 's appeal among Democrats rooted in his opposition, his stance and the question of whether he has been consistent are likely to be themes throughout his battle for the Democratic nomination, especially if Mr. Obama uses his position to suggest that Mrs. Clinton and other candidates failed to be sufficiently skeptical of the Bush administration.

Speaker Pelosi Tempts Disaster: As incoming speaker, Ms. Pelosi will be dogged by skepticism -- from within the party and without -- about her political smarts and her ability to deliver a galvanized agenda.

      "Ehud Olmert ; born 30 September 1945) is an Israeli politician and lawyer. He served as the 12th Prime Minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009 and before that as a cabinet minister from 1988 to 1992 and from 2003 to 2006. Between his first and second stints as a cabinet member, he served as mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003. After serving as PM he was sentenced to serve a prison term over convictions for accepting bribes and for obstruction of justice during his terms as mayor of Jerusalem and as trade minister. Mahmoud Abbas , also known by the kunya Abu Mazen , is the President of the State of Palestine and Palestinian National Authority. He has been the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization since 11 November 2004, and Palestinian president since 15 January 2005 . Abbas is a member of the Fatah party and was elected Chairman of Fatah in 2009. U.S.-Sponsored Mideast Talks Conclude With Little Result: Beyond that, Israel 's government is deeply skeptical of Mr. Abbas 's ability to deliver calm, let alone a peace agreement. Mr. Olmert and his aides view Mr. Abbas as weakened by the Mecca agreement. Ehud Olmert, Mahmoud Abbas\n",

He has served in the House since 1997, and is a member of the Republican Party. On August 30, 2019, Shimkus announced that he will not seek re-election for his seat in 2020. Mark Adam Foley is a former member of the United States House of Representatives. He served from 1995 until 2006, representing the 16th District of Florida as a member of the Republican Party, before resigning due to revelations that he had sent sexually explicit messages to teenaged boys who had served as congressional pages. No Early Foley Complaints, Head of Pages Says: But speaking to reporters, Mr. Shimkus said,'' The first time I had any indication that I needed to address Congressman Foley'' was after being alerted to the e-mail exchange with the former page from Louisiana. When asked whether Republican leaders had told him to exclude other members of the page board -- a Republican, a Democrat and the House sergeant-at-arms -- when ultimately confronting Mr. Foley last year, Mr. Shimkus replied,'' I made the decision.''

He previously served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007 and Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006. In late August 2019, Abe surpassed his great-uncle, Eisaku Satō, to become the second-longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, and the longest-serving Prime Minister in post-war Japan. Japan's Leaders Rigged Voter Forums, a Government Report Says: But a government report released Wednesday concluded that two-thirds of the town meetings organized by the Japanese government since 2001 were Soviet-style performances with people paid to ask planted questions -- favorable to the government. The report was the latest blow for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , whose approval ratings have plummeted to below 50 percent because he has backed off on political and economic changes undertaken by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi .

      "Eliot Laurence Spitzer is an American politician, attorney, and educator. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 54th Governor of New York. Joseph Louis Bruno is an American businessman and Republican politician from upstate New York. Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Sheldon Silver is a former lawyer, Democratic Party politician from New York City and convicted felon who served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1994 until 2015. The Reform Window: His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O'Connell, the Republican, is government reform. Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer , Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce'' sweeping reforms'' of the way the state budget is put together. Eliot Spitzer, Joseph L. Bruno, Sheldon Silver\n",

He was confirmed by the Senate this month, but it is unlikely that he will retain that job after Mr. Pataki leaves office at the end of the year. Last week, Mr. Weld 's opponent , John Faso , a former state assemblyman , chose C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, as his running mate. Christopher L. Jacobs, John J. Faso, William F. Weld\n",

He previously served as head of government relations and communications at Bloomberg L.P. and as chairman of Bloomberg Government. Sheekey also previously served as deputy mayor for government affairs for the City of New York under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He is credited with managing Mayor Bloomberg's three successful campaigns for Mayor of New York. Michael Rubens Bloomberg KBE is an American businessman, politician, author, and philanthropist. As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Strategist With Sharp Elbows Has Bloomberg Swinging Away: Kevin Sheekey , Mayor Michael R Bloomberg 's top political strategist and deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations, has gone on virtual war footing to make sure Bloomberg pushes through his agenda before he is forced to leave office in 2009 by term limits. Several officials upstate and downstate say they are watching to see whether Bloomberg benefits from his new aggressiveness or whether it backfires to damage city 's relations with its partners in government. Joseph L Bruno , Senate majority leader , has expressed displeasure with new tone from City Hall, but Sheekey is unbowed. Joseph L. Bruno, Kevin Sheekey, Michael R. Bloomberg\n",

Mr. Gehry 's Guggenheim, planned for a choice site at the tip of the island, is also conceived as a series of galleries loosely arranged around open-air courtyards, a bit like a souk.

      "Anthony Pellicano is a former high-profile Los Angeles private investigator, known as a Hollywood fixer. He notably served a term of thirty months in a federal prison for illegal possession of explosives, firearms and homemade grenades. In 2008, he began serving an additional sentence for subsequent convictions for other crimes, including racketeering and wiretapping. David Michael Hasselhoff , nicknamed \"The Hoff\", is an American actor, singer, producer, and businessman, who set a Guinness World Record as the most watched man on TV. Keith Ian Carradine is an American actor, singer and songwriter who has had success on stage, film and television. He is known for his roles as Tom Frank in Robert Altman's Nashville, Wild Bill Hickok in the HBO series Deadwood, FBI agent Frank Lundy in Dexter and US President Conrad Dalton in Madam Secretary. In addition, he is a Golden Globe- and Academy Award-winning songwriter. As a member of the Carradine family, he is part of an acting dynasty that began with his father, John Carradine. Sandra Will Carradine is an American film and television actress. She was formerly married to actor-singer-songwriter Keith Carradine, and around the time of their separation she became involved with Anthony Pellicano, a high-profile Hollywood private investigator who was involved in extensive illegal wiretapping activities. In 2006, she pleaded guilty to perjury for lying under oath about her awareness of Pellicano's wiretapping of Keith Carradine's phone. Arts, Briefly: Keith Carradine is suing Anthony Pellicano , the detective who was charged last month in the huge wiretapping scandal that has preoccupied Hollywood for months. In the complaint, filed Friday, Mr. Carradine contends that the detective conspired with Mr. Carradine 's ex-wife , Sandra Carradine , to eavesdrop on his conversations illegally. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order against the former'' Baywatch'' star David Hasselhoff , requiring him to stay at least 100 yards away from his estranged wife, Pamela Bach, according to court papers unsealed last week.

Foley Case Snags Incumbent In Ohio Race for House Seat: But nowhere else has it become quite as pitched as here, where Ms. Kilroy -- who had already been trying to link Ms. Pryce to corruption scandals in Ohio involving Republicans -- has moved in with withering attacks since Mr. Foley resigned. In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Kilroy questioned whether Ms. Pryce had had any warning about Mr. Foley 's conduct, and why Ms. Pryce , the No. 4 Republican in the House, had not called for the resignation of Representative J.

After retiring from the Marine Corps, he began working as the chief military correspondent for The New York Times. He was subsequently a military analyst for NBC. With Michael Gordon, he was the author of three accounts of American wars in Iraq, The Generals War ; Cobra II ; and Endgame . Michael R. Gordon has been a national security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal since October 2017. Previously he was a military and diplomacy correspondent for The New York Times for 32 years. During the first phase of the Iraq War, he was the only newspaper reporter embedded with the allied land command under General Tommy Franks, a position that \"granted him unique access to cover the invasion strategy and its enactment\". He and General Bernard E. Trainor have written three books together, including the best-selling Cobra II. The Rumsfeld Doctrine: But with an administration where power is concentrated in the hands of a few, Gordon and Trainor 's focus on the military bureaucracy results in a somewhat constricted portrait of what actually took place. Indeed, Gordon and Trainor 's book suggests a conclusion they do n't draw: the initial impulse for war may have had little to do with Iraq itself. Bernard E. Trainor, Michael R. Gordon\n",

      "Iowa ) is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north. Kansas  is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita, with its most populated county being Johnson County. Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north; Missouri on the east; Oklahoma on the south; and Colorado on the west. Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks. The tribe's name is often said to mean \"people of the wind\" although this was probably not the term's original meaning. Ohio  is a Midwestern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Of the fifty states, it is the 34th largest by area, the seventh most populous, and the tenth most densely populated. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. Ohio is bordered by Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Lake Erie to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast. Virginia ), officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States located between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. LACKING PAPERS, CITIZENS ARE CUT FROM MEDICAID: A new federal rule intended to keep illegal immigrants from receiving Medicaid has instead shut out tens of thousands of United States citizens who have had difficulty complying with requirements to show birth certificates and other documents proving their citizenship, state officials say. Florida, Iowa , Kansas , Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia have all reported declines in enrollment and traced them to the new federal requirement, which comes just as state officials around the country are striving to expand coverage through Medicaid and other means.

Her 2004 book Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century, a description of psychology experiments \"narrated as stories\", has drawn both praise and criticism. It was nominated for a Los Angeles Times Kirsch award for science and technology writing, and was named as a 2005 Bild Der Wissenschaft book of the year in Germany. Expecting Too Much From a Mind Drug: Her unfortunate and dated description of psychotropic medication as a'' chemical crutch'' belies what knowledgeable psychiatrists teach their patients: that medication is merely a bridge between feeling bad and feeling better; that the individual must still walk across that bridge; and that the waters below are still dangerous.

Located along the Tigris River, the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the Islamic world. Iran, also called Persia, and officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. With 82 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 18th most populous country. Its territory spans 1,648,195 km2 , making it the second largest country in the Middle East and the 17th largest in the world. Iran is bordered to the northwest by Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, to the north by the Caspian Sea, to the northeast by Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. BUSH DECLARES IRAN'S ARMS ROLE IN IRAQ IS CERTAIN: Pres Bush says he is certain that factions within Iranian government supplied Shiites in Iraq with bombs that have killed American troops but does not know if Iran 's highest officials directed attacks. His most specific accusations to date reflect concerted effort to present clearer, more direct case on Iran 's role. Bush tells news conference that skepticism is` preposterous.' Asserts` with certainty' that Quds Force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards has provided sophisticated bombs and vows to protect troops. Defends sending more troops into Baghdad . Maj Gen William Caldwell, speaking in Baghdad , provides more detailed, on-the-record account of how administration believes explosively formed penetrators got to Iraq, although he is careful not to link Quds Force directly. Cites information from Iranians detained in Iraq recently. Bush also says what matters is that US is` responding,' not whether senior Iranian leaders are involved. Intense skepticism from Democrats and experts like David Kay, and charge that Bush uses Iran as scapegoat for Iraq failures, noted. Baghdad, Iran\n",

In Unpredictable District, Some Say Bush Is Politicizing Terrorism: While it is too early to know whether the White House will succeed in winning over enough voters to make a difference in what is shaping up as a tight race, the interviews suggested that Mr. Bush 's newest efforts to cast his party as better suited than Democrats to defend the country had yet to overcome concern and anger among many voters about Iraq and a more generalized sense of discontent with the administration.''

      "Virgin America Inc. was an American airline that operated between 2007 and 2018, when it was integrated into Alaska Airlines. The airline primarily focused on operating low-fare service between cities on the West Coast and other major metropolitan areas, with higher quality service. It was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, and operated domestic flights to major U.S. cities, primarily from hubs at San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas. An American Version of Virgin Atlantic Is Tentatively Approved for Service: Virgin America , a proposed start-up airline backed by Richard Branson , won tentative approval to operate from the Transportation Department after agreeing to jettison its chief executive and revamp its financing to reduce the influence of Mr. Branson and other non-United States citizens. If Virgin America succeeds in starting operations this summer, as planned, it would add a major new player in the market for flights between the East Coast and West Coast, potentially pushing fares down and offering travelers more choices.

Dār is an Arabic word meaning \"home [of]\" – the region was named Dardaju while ruled by the Daju, who migrated from Meroë c. 350 AD, and it was then renamed Dartunjur when the Tunjur ruled the area. Darfur was an independent sultanate for several hundred years, incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916. Sudan or the Sudan , officially the Republic of the Sudan , is a country in Northeast Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea to the east, Ethiopia to the southeast, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. It has a population of 43 million people and occupies a total area of 1,886,068 square kilometres , making it the third-largest country in Africa. Sudanese Soldiers Flee War To Find a Limbo in Chad: The Sudanese government has vowed to crush the remaining rebel factions, and has forcefully rejected a Security Council resolution authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping force of more than 20,000 troops and police officers in Darfur to replace an overmatched and under-equipped African Union force. In August, Sudan made a counterproposal, saying it would use its own troops to quell the uprising. Darfur, Sudan\n",

      "Robert Allan Caro is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of United States political figures Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson. Robert Moses was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban development in the United States. A Tale Of Two Cities: Co-op City, in the Bronx, was built on the site of the defunct Freedomland amusement park; Moses did not tear down tenements to make room for it. Correction: May 27, 2007, Sunday An article on May 6 about Robert Caro and his biography of Robert Moses referred imprecisely to Moses' role in Westway, a 1970s proposal for a superhighway and park development on the West Side of Manhattan.

In between his presidential terms, he was also the Prime Minister of Russia under president Dmitry Medvedev. Post-Putin: Announcing one 's own candidacy is, in fact, tantamount to declaring one 's open opposition to the Kremlin, to the smooth transition of power, to Putin himself . Even the parliamentary opposition is wary of doing that. So far in this quasi-election season only two people have done it: a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and, improbably, Aleksandr V. Donskoi , the youthful mayor of Arkhangelsk, a small port city on the White Sea. Both promptly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors, even as the mass media piled on in the way they never do with today 's authorities, certainly not the likes of Putin , Ivanov or Medvedev .

Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Joseph Isadore Lieberman is an American politician, lobbyist and attorney who served as a United States Senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 election. During his final term in office he was officially listed as an independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party. Edward Miner Lamont Jr. is an American businessman and politician serving as the 89th governor of Connecticut since January 9, 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a Greenwich selectman from 1987 to 1989. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006, defeating incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman in the state Democratic primary election. Lamont Criticizes Lieberman's 1998 Rebuke of Clinton Over Affair: Senator Lieberman said what he believed. And many people believe that by making the statement he did, and separating the moral ramifications from any legal questions he helped defuse the case for impeachment to protect President Clinton 's presidency.'' As the two Senate candidates returned to Connecticut from Washington on Thursday, Mr. Lamont unveiled a new campaign commercial featuring a young man reading the names of several soldiers who were killed in the war in Iraq.

      "Barack Hussein Obama II ; born August 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Clinton Camp Challenges Obama on Iraq: Yet when it came later to hypothetical questioning about how he would have voted on the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Mr. Obama has been more circumspect. With the war a central issue in the campaign and with part of Mr. Obama 's appeal among Democrats rooted in his opposition, his stance and the question of whether he has been consistent are likely to be themes throughout his battle for the Democratic nomination, especially if Mr. Obama uses his position to suggest that Mrs. Clinton and other candidates failed to be sufficiently skeptical of the Bush administration. Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton\n",

Speaker Pelosi Tempts Disaster: As incoming speaker, Ms. Pelosi will be dogged by skepticism -- from within the party and without -- about her political smarts and her ability to deliver a galvanized agenda.

Secret to Mickelson's Success: Going Back to Drawing Board: The threesome -- as they have now done on three occasions -- created a strategy that helped Mickelson win a major championship, a two-shot victory Sunday at the Masters that seemed to portend more of the same.'' I could n't have done this by myself,'' Mickelson said after winning his second green jacket.'' To have the help from Dave Pelz and Rick Smith , it has really given me the guidance.

Shinzō Abe zoː]; born 21 September 1954) is a Japanese politician who has been Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party since 2012. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007 and Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006. In late August 2019, Abe surpassed his great-uncle, Eisaku Satō, to become the second-longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, and the longest-serving Prime Minister in post-war Japan. Japan's Leaders Rigged Voter Forums, a Government Report Says: But a government report released Wednesday concluded that two-thirds of the town meetings organized by the Japanese government since 2001 were Soviet-style performances with people paid to ask planted questions -- favorable to the government. The report was the latest blow for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , whose approval ratings have plummeted to below 50 percent because he has backed off on political and economic changes undertaken by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi .

Joseph Louis Bruno is an American businessman and Republican politician from upstate New York. Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Sheldon Silver is a former lawyer, Democratic Party politician from New York City and convicted felon who served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1994 until 2015. The Reform Window: His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O'Connell, the Republican, is government reform. Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer , Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce'' sweeping reforms'' of the way the state budget is put together. Eliot Spitzer, Joseph L.

In May 2019, Jacobs announced that he was running for New York's 27th congressional district in the 2020 elections.

Faso ran for New York State Comptroller in 2002 and for Governor of New York in 2006, but did not prevail in either race. William Floyd Weld is an American attorney, businessman, author, and Republican politician who served as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997. Weld is currently running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2020. Republican Says Weld Will Name Secretary of State as His Running Mate: In April, Gov. George E. Pataki named Mr. Jacobs to replace Randy A. Daniels as secretary of state . He was confirmed by the Senate this month, but it is unlikely that he will retain that job after Mr. Pataki leaves office at the end of the year. Last week, Mr. Weld 's opponent , John Faso , a former state assemblyman , chose C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, as his running mate. Christopher L. Jacobs, John J.

Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Kevin Sheekey is an American businessman and political adviser. He is the Global Head of Communications, Government Relations and Marketing for Bloomberg L.P. He previously served as head of government relations and communications at Bloomberg L.P. and as chairman of Bloomberg Government. Sheekey also previously served as deputy mayor for government affairs for the City of New York under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He is credited with managing Mayor Bloomberg's three successful campaigns for Mayor of New York. Michael Rubens Bloomberg KBE is an American businessman, politician, author, and philanthropist. As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Strategist With Sharp Elbows Has Bloomberg Swinging Away: Kevin Sheekey , Mayor Michael R Bloomberg 's top political strategist and deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations, has gone on virtual war footing to make sure Bloomberg pushes through his agenda before he is forced to leave office in 2009 by term limits. Several officials upstate and downstate say they are watching to see whether Bloomberg benefits from his new aggressiveness or whether it backfires to damage city 's relations with its partners in government. Joseph L Bruno , Senate majority leader , has expressed displeasure with new tone from City Hall, but Sheekey is unbowed. Joseph L. Bruno, Kevin Sheekey, Michael R. Bloomberg\n",

      "Frank Owen Gehry, , FAIA February 28, 1929) is a Canadian-born American architect, residing in Los Angeles. Jean Nouvel is a French architect. Nouvel studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and was a founding member of Mars 1976 and Syndicat de l'Architecture. He has obtained a number of prestigious distinctions over the course of his career, including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture , the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2005 and the Pritzker Prize in 2008. A number of museums and architectural centres have presented retrospectives of his work. A Vision in the Desert: Mr. Nouvel also envisions the art spilling out onto the alleyways and courtyards, from sculpture to mosaics. Mr. Gehry 's Guggenheim, planned for a choice site at the tip of the island, is also conceived as a series of galleries loosely arranged around open-air courtyards, a bit like a souk.

The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Arabs, Kurds, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians and Kawliya. In Unpredictable District, Some Say Bush Is Politicizing Terrorism: While it is too early to know whether the White House will succeed in winning over enough voters to make a difference in what is shaping up as a tight race, the interviews suggested that Mr. Bush 's newest efforts to cast his party as better suited than Democrats to defend the country had yet to overcome concern and anger among many voters about Iraq and a more generalized sense of discontent with the administration.'' I have been a Republican all my life, but we have just gotten to the point where we may need a change,'' said Shannon Abote, an Arvada resident who was stopping at Starbucks for a coffee on Monday morning.

He is nicknamed Il Cavaliere for his Order of Merit for Labour, although he voluntarily resigned from this order in March 2014. A Look at Italian Politics, A Peek at American Films: Beguiled by an attractive young screenwriter (Jasmine Trinca), Bruno decides to make an anti-Berlusconi picture (also called'' The Caiman ,'' which is more or less a synonym for crocodile), and encounters various obstacles, ranging from the skepticism of financiers and the unreliability of actors to his own temperamental befuddlement. After all, he admits at one point, he was a Berlusconi voter. Nanni Moretti, Silvio Berlusconi\n",

      "Virgin America Inc. was an American airline that operated between 2007 and 2018, when it was integrated into Alaska Airlines. The airline primarily focused on operating low-fare service between cities on the West Coast and other major metropolitan areas, with higher quality service. It was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, and operated domestic flights to major U.S. cities, primarily from hubs at San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas. An American Version of Virgin Atlantic Is Tentatively Approved for Service: Virgin America , a proposed start-up airline backed by Richard Branson , won tentative approval to operate from the Transportation Department after agreeing to jettison its chief executive and revamp its financing to reduce the influence of Mr. Branson and other non-United States citizens. If Virgin America succeeds in starting operations this summer, as planned, it would add a major new player in the market for flights between the East Coast and West Coast, potentially pushing fares down and offering travelers more choices.

Dār is an Arabic word meaning \"home [of]\" – the region was named Dardaju while ruled by the Daju, who migrated from Meroë c. 350 AD, and it was then renamed Dartunjur when the Tunjur ruled the area. Darfur was an independent sultanate for several hundred years, incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916. Sudan or the Sudan , officially the Republic of the Sudan , is a country in Northeast Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea to the east, Ethiopia to the southeast, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. It has a population of 43 million people and occupies a total area of 1,886,068 square kilometres , making it the third-largest country in Africa. Sudanese Soldiers Flee War To Find a Limbo in Chad: The Sudanese government has vowed to crush the remaining rebel factions, and has forcefully rejected a Security Council resolution authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping force of more than 20,000 troops and police officers in Darfur to replace an overmatched and under-equipped African Union force. In August, Sudan made a counterproposal, saying it would use its own troops to quell the uprising. Darfur, Sudan\n",

Robert Moses was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban development in the United States. A Tale Of Two Cities: Co-op City, in the Bronx, was built on the site of the defunct Freedomland amusement park; Moses did not tear down tenements to make room for it. Correction: May 27, 2007, Sunday An article on May 6 about Robert Caro and his biography of Robert Moses referred imprecisely to Moses' role in Westway, a 1970s proposal for a superhighway and park development on the West Side of Manhattan.

Mr. Bennett also said he would submit a detailed rebuttal of the recollections of two top officials who testified to the special committee this week that, contrary to Mr. Wolfowitz 's recollection, they had not approved all aspects of Ms. Riza 's compensation arrangements.''

In between his presidential terms, he was also the Prime Minister of Russia under president Dmitry Medvedev. Post-Putin: Announcing one 's own candidacy is, in fact, tantamount to declaring one 's open opposition to the Kremlin, to the smooth transition of power, to Putin himself . Even the parliamentary opposition is wary of doing that. So far in this quasi-election season only two people have done it: a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and, improbably, Aleksandr V. Donskoi , the youthful mayor of Arkhangelsk, a small port city on the White Sea. Both promptly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors, even as the mass media piled on in the way they never do with today 's authorities, certainly not the likes of Putin , Ivanov or Medvedev .

Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Joseph Isadore Lieberman is an American politician, lobbyist and attorney who served as a United States Senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 election. During his final term in office he was officially listed as an independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party. Edward Miner Lamont Jr. is an American businessman and politician serving as the 89th governor of Connecticut since January 9, 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a Greenwich selectman from 1987 to 1989. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006, defeating incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman in the state Democratic primary election. Lamont Criticizes Lieberman's 1998 Rebuke of Clinton Over Affair: Senator Lieberman said what he believed. And many people believe that by making the statement he did, and separating the moral ramifications from any legal questions he helped defuse the case for impeachment to protect President Clinton 's presidency.'' As the two Senate candidates returned to Connecticut from Washington on Thursday, Mr. Lamont unveiled a new campaign commercial featuring a young man reading the names of several soldiers who were killed in the war in Iraq.

      "Barack Hussein Obama II ; born August 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Clinton Camp Challenges Obama on Iraq: Yet when it came later to hypothetical questioning about how he would have voted on the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Mr. Obama has been more circumspect. With the war a central issue in the campaign and with part of Mr. Obama 's appeal among Democrats rooted in his opposition, his stance and the question of whether he has been consistent are likely to be themes throughout his battle for the Democratic nomination, especially if Mr. Obama uses his position to suggest that Mrs. Clinton and other candidates failed to be sufficiently skeptical of the Bush administration. Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton\n",

Murtha, a Democrat, represented Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1974 until his death in 2010.

Nancy Patricia Pelosi is an American Democratic Party politician serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since January 2019.

First elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history. Speaker Pelosi Tempts Disaster: As incoming speaker, Ms. Pelosi will be dogged by skepticism -- from within the party and without -- about her political smarts and her ability to deliver a galvanized agenda. It was a no-brainer for the caucus to end the misguided fight for Mr. Murtha , who belittled the need for reform. John P. Murtha, Nancy Pelosi\n",

She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Jonathan Bernard Yoav Tasini is a strategist, organizer, activist, commentator and writer, primarily focusing his energies on the topics of work, labor and the economy. On June 11, 2009, he announced that he would challenge New York U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in the Democratic primary for the 2010 U.S. Senate special election in New York. However, Tasini later decided to run instead for a seat in the House of Representatives in 2010. Phil Arnold was an American screen, stage, television, and vaudeville actor. He appeared in approximately 150 films and television shows between 1939 and 1968. Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Republican Candidate Points To Clinton's Opponent: Mr. Arnold included a link to Mr. Tasini 's Web site and suggested that Spencer supporters pass it along. Mrs. Clinton voted to authorize military action in Iraq and has said that troops should not be withdrawn in haste, but she has also been critical of the execution of the war and recently called for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jonathan Tasini, Phil Arnold\n",

When asked whether Republican leaders had told him to exclude other members of the page board -- a Republican, a Democrat and the House sergeant-at-arms -- when ultimately confronting Mr. Foley last year, Mr. Shimkus replied,'' I made the decision.''

Prodi Predicts His Tiny Margin Over Berlusconi Will Prevail: Mr. Prodi said he had begun talks on who would fill his cabinet and vowed his government would pass a conflict-of-interest law. But he said it would not be aimed at Mr. Berlusconi , 69, Italy 's richest man, who has often been accused of passing laws in his own interest. Romano Prodi, Silvio Berlusconi\n",

Fitzgerald is an American lawyer and partner at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom since October 2012.For more than a decade, until June 30, 2012, Fitzgerald was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Timothy John Russert was an American television journalist and lawyer who appeared for more than 16 years as the longest-serving moderator of NBC's Meet the Press. He was a senior vice president at NBC News, Washington bureau chief and also hosted an eponymous CNBC/MSNBC weekend interview program. He was a frequent correspondent and guest on NBC's The Today Show and Hardball. Russert covered several presidential elections, and he presented the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey on the NBC Nightly News during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. IN CLOSING PLEAS, CLASHING VIEWS ON LIBBY'S ROLE: Defense and prosecution in perjury trial of former White House aide Lewis Libby make final summations. Prosecutors led by Patrick Fitzgerald review charge that Libby willfully lied to FBI agents and grand jury investigating leak of identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame in effort to discredit her husband Joseph Wilson, who debunked story that Iraq had tried to buy uranium in Niger. Theodore Wells argues tearfully that any inaccuracies were innocent memory lapses explained by Libby 's pressing schedule as Vice Pres Cheney 's chief of staff. Fitzgerald says disclosure left cloud over White House and Cheney because he was behind effort and that Libby decided to lie rather than risk being prosecuted for leaking agent 's name. Wells disparages newsman Tim Russert 's credibility in saying he did not reveal name to Libby because he did not know it until he read Robert Novak 's column on July 14, 2003. Patrick J.

      "Eliot Laurence Spitzer is an American politician, attorney, and educator. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 54th Governor of New York. Joseph Louis Bruno is an American businessman and Republican politician from upstate New York. Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Sheldon Silver is a former lawyer, Democratic Party politician from New York City and convicted felon who served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1994 until 2015. The Reform Window: His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O'Connell, the Republican, is government reform. Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer , Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce'' sweeping reforms'' of the way the state budget is put together. Eliot Spitzer, Joseph L. Bruno, Sheldon Silver\n",

      "Barack Hussein Obama II ; born August 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. A New Kind of Politics Closely Resembles the Old: The Obama campaign was forced to acknowledge authorship when the Clinton campaign got a copy and shared it with The New York Times. For the Clinton campaign, drawing attention to a document attacking its own candidate had the effect of demonstrating that Mr. Obama , like other candidates, is not above a bit of political street fighting and, by implication, should not be allowed to cast himself as a champion of a purer version of public service.

In May 2019, Jacobs announced that he was running for New York's 27th congressional district in the 2020 elections. John James Faso Jr.  is an American attorney and politician who served as the U.S. Representative for New York's 19th congressional district from 2017 to 2019. Faso was first elected to the post in 2016. A Republican, Faso previously represented the 102nd district in the New York State Assembly from 1987 to 2002 and served as Assembly Minority Leader from 1998 to 2002. Faso ran for New York State Comptroller in 2002 and for Governor of New York in 2006, but did not prevail in either race. William Floyd Weld is an American attorney, businessman, author, and Republican politician who served as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997. Weld is currently running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2020. Republican Says Weld Will Name Secretary of State as His Running Mate: In April, Gov. George E. Pataki named Mr. Jacobs to replace Randy A. Daniels as secretary of state . He was confirmed by the Senate this month, but it is unlikely that he will retain that job after Mr. Pataki leaves office at the end of the year. Last week, Mr. Weld 's opponent , John Faso , a former state assemblyman , chose C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, as his running mate. Christopher L. Jacobs, John J.

As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Strategist With Sharp Elbows Has Bloomberg Swinging Away: Kevin Sheekey , Mayor Michael R Bloomberg 's top political strategist and deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations, has gone on virtual war footing to make sure Bloomberg pushes through his agenda before he is forced to leave office in 2009 by term limits. Several officials upstate and downstate say they are watching to see whether Bloomberg benefits from his new aggressiveness or whether it backfires to damage city 's relations with its partners in government. Joseph L Bruno , Senate majority leader , has expressed displeasure with new tone from City Hall, but Sheekey is unbowed. Joseph L. Bruno, Kevin Sheekey, Michael R. Bloomberg\n",

A number of museums and architectural centres have presented retrospectives of his work. A Vision in the Desert: Mr. Nouvel also envisions the art spilling out onto the alleyways and courtyards, from sculpture to mosaics. Mr. Gehry 's Guggenheim, planned for a choice site at the tip of the island, is also conceived as a series of galleries loosely arranged around open-air courtyards, a bit like a souk.

He served as the Artistic Director of the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California from 1981 through the end of 2007.O'Brien has won three Tony Awards and been nominated for seven more, and won five Drama Desk Awards. Sir Tom Stoppard  is a Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter. He has written prolifically for TV, radio, film and stage, finding prominence with plays such as Arcadia, The Coast of Utopia, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Professional Foul, The Real Thing, Travesties, The Invention of Love, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. He co-wrote the screenplays for Brazil, The Russia House, and Shakespeare in Love, and has received an Academy Award and four Tony Awards. History's Sweep, In Words And Silence: That 's Mr. Stoppard 's sublimely theatrical way of admitting that words, his beloved stock in trade, ultimately do n't count for much in the course of human events. Many of his characters come to the same conclusion in'' Shipwreck,'' which is directed by Jack O'Brien with the same seductive vividness he brought to the trilogy 's first part,'' Voyage,'' which opened last month .

Edwards is known for the 1978 \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", where he recovered a fumble by Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik, for a touchdown during the waning seconds of a certain Eagles loss, to turn it into a victory. Robert Terrence \"Terry\" Bradway is an American football executive. He served as the general manager for the New York Jets of the National Football League from 2001 to 2006. Bradway worked in the personnel department for the Kansas City Chiefs prior to being hired as general manager of the Jets. In His Silence, Bradway Seems To Drop Hint: Because public speaking does not appear to be one of Bradway 's favorite things, he was happy to cede the spotlight over the last five years to Edwards, who became, by default, the face and voice of the organization.''

Police Chief Places Blame For Deaths of Two Officers: The chief of the Jersey City Police Department blamed state transportation officials on Friday for the deaths of two officers who drove off an open vertical lift bridge, saying that the bridge was in chronic disrepair and that the operators compounded the danger by failing to tell the officers exactly when the deck was going to be raised. Chief Robert A. Troy delivered a minute-by-minute report of the Christmas night accident, from the first businesslike call that the bridge needed to be lifted for a passing tugboat to the final grief-streaked radio transmissions made seconds after Officers Shawn Carson and Robert Nguyen plunged into the frigid waters of the Hackensack River.''

      "Virgin America Inc. was an American airline that operated between 2007 and 2018, when it was integrated into Alaska Airlines. The airline primarily focused on operating low-fare service between cities on the West Coast and other major metropolitan areas, with higher quality service. It was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, and operated domestic flights to major U.S. cities, primarily from hubs at San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas. An American Version of Virgin Atlantic Is Tentatively Approved for Service: Virgin America , a proposed start-up airline backed by Richard Branson , won tentative approval to operate from the Transportation Department after agreeing to jettison its chief executive and revamp its financing to reduce the influence of Mr. Branson and other non-United States citizens. If Virgin America succeeds in starting operations this summer, as planned, it would add a major new player in the market for flights between the East Coast and West Coast, potentially pushing fares down and offering travelers more choices.

Bennett, said he hoped that the board would acknowledge that whatever happened, the bank president had sincerely tried to do the right thing and arranged for the pay increase only after consulting widely. Mr. Bennett also said he would submit a detailed rebuttal of the recollections of two top officials who testified to the special committee this week that, contrary to Mr. Wolfowitz 's recollection, they had not approved all aspects of Ms. Riza 's compensation arrangements.''

The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from members of the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo.

The two men wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting , Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman , intend to testify, said Mr. Hardy, and will most likely do so toward the end of the grand jury process.''

In his prime, Majid Khan was considered one of the best batsmen in the world, able to decimate any bowling attack, including the mighty West Indian fast bowlers of that era. In an 18-year Test career, he only played in 63 Test matches, primarily because Pakistan played a very limited Test match schedule. Khan's first-class career spanned 1961 to 1985. Uzair Paracha is a Pakistani American convicted of providing material support to al-Qaeda by a court in New York City in 2005. He received a 30-year prison sentence which was later voided. Pakistani Gets 30 Years for Aiding Qaeda Operative: According to trial testimony and Justice Department documents, Mr. Khan had planned with top Qaeda leaders in Pakistan to bomb underground storage tanks at gas stations in Maryland. Mr. Paracha impersonated Mr. Khan , including posing as him during telephone calls with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and using his credit card to make it appear as though Mr. Khan had never left the United States, when in fact he had gone to Pakistan without notifying immigration authorities.

      "Context:\n",
      "Simon Wiesenthal was a Jewish Austrian Holocaust survivor, Nazi hunter, and writer. He studied architecture and was living in Lwów at the outbreak of World War II. He survived the Janowska concentration camp , the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp , the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, a death march to Chemnitz, Buchenwald, and the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp . I Have Never Forgotten You: Directed by Richard Trank Not rated; 105 minutes The legacy of the concentration camp survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal is one of unimpeachable bravery, but'' I Have Never Forgotten You,'' a new documentary, is a suspect monument to his courage. Directed by Richard Trank , also its co-author , the film effectively sketches Mr. Wiesenthal 's life, from his tenacity in surviving the genocide that claimed much of his family, to his determination to identify, find and punish ex-Nazis after World War II, at a time when many governments would have preferred to'' move on.''

      "Robert Allan Caro is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of United States political figures Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson. Robert Moses was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban development in the United States. A Tale Of Two Cities: Co-op City, in the Bronx, was built on the site of the defunct Freedomland amusement park; Moses did not tear down tenements to make room for it. Correction: May 27, 2007, Sunday An article on May 6 about Robert Caro and his biography of Robert Moses referred imprecisely to Moses' role in Westway, a 1970s proposal for a superhighway and park development on the West Side of Manhattan.

A Look at Italian Politics, A Peek at American Films: Beguiled by an attractive young screenwriter (Jasmine Trinca), Bruno decides to make an anti-Berlusconi picture (also called'' The Caiman ,'' which is more or less a synonym for crocodile), and encounters various obstacles, ranging from the skepticism of financiers and the unreliability of actors to his own temperamental befuddlement. After all, he admits at one point, he was a Berlusconi voter. Nanni Moretti, Silvio Berlusconi\n",

Pact With Iran On Gas Sales Is Possible, Putin Says: Russian Pres Vladimir V Putin, holding his annual winter news conference, reiterates Russia 's opposition to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, but says Russia is considering OPEC-like cooperation with Tehran on sales of natural gas. Russia is holding out for negotiated compromise on Iran , position at odds with Bush administration 's efforts to turn Iran 's leadership into political and economic pariahs. Putin 's senior aide Igor S Ivanov visited Iran last week and discussed nuclear issue, as well as potential energy cooperation with Iran , which has reserves of natural gas second only to Russia 's .

It covers an area of around 274,200 square kilometres and is surrounded by six countries: Mali to the north; Niger to the east; Benin to the southeast; Togo and Ghana to the south; and Ivory Coast to the southwest. The July 2019 population estimate by the United Nations was 20,321,378. Burkina Faso is a francophone country, with French as the official language of government and business. Roughly 40% of the population speaks the Mossi language. Ivory Coast or Côte d'Ivoire, officially the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, is a country located on the south coast of West Africa. Ivory Coast's political capital is Yamoussoukro in the centre of the country, while its economic capital and largest city is the port city of Abidjan. It borders Guinea and Liberia to the west, Burkina Faso and Mali to the north, Ghana to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. Ivory Coast Leader Signs Accord With Rebels: Civil war broke out in Ivory Coast in September 2002 after a long period of upheaval and economic decline that followed the death of its first leader, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, in 1993. The causes of the conflict were complex, rooted largely in the tension between the predominantly Muslim north, where many people are descendants of immigrants from neighboring countries like Burkina Faso and Mali, and the largely Christian and animist ethnic people of the south, some of whom claim to be the true Ivorians.

Russia Considers Alternatives to the Oil Pipeline Through Belarus: With the new year, Russia began charging Belarus $ 100 per thousand cubic meters of gas, more than double the old rate of$ 46. It also imposed a duty of$ 180 a ton on oil that officials said Belarus was obtaining at subsidized rates and reselling on world markets. In response, Belarus imposed a transshipment fee of$ 45 a ton on oil going through Belarus in the Druzhba pipeline to Europe . On Monday, officials in Moscow accused Belarus of siphoning off about 79,000 tons -- roughly half a million barrels -- of Russian oil bound for Europe , then shut down the pipeline entirely. Normally the 2,500-mile pipeline pumps 1.2 million barrels a day to Eastern and Central Europe , with one arm running to Poland and Germany and the other to Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic .

Russia Considers Alternatives to the Oil Pipeline Through Belarus: With the new year, Russia began charging Belarus $ 100 per thousand cubic meters of gas, more than double the old rate of$ 46. It also imposed a duty of$ 180 a ton on oil that officials said Belarus was obtaining at subsidized rates and reselling on world markets. In response, Belarus imposed a transshipment fee of$ 45 a ton on oil going through Belarus in the Druzhba pipeline to Europe. On Monday, officials in Moscow accused Belarus of siphoning off about 79,000 tons -- roughly half a million barrels -- of Russian oil bound for Europe, then shut down the pipeline entirely. Normally the 2,500-mile pipeline pumps 1.2 million barrels a day to Eastern and Central Europe, with one arm running to Poland and Germany and the other to Ukraine , Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic .

In late August, appearing in front of an Islamic group in Washington, Mr. Mearsheimer extended the argument to say that American support of the war in Lebanon had been another example of Israeli interests trumping American ones.

Bush and His Iran Credibility Gap: Four letters comment on Feb 15 article about Pres Bush 's claim that Iran is providing arms to Iraq . David Schwartz says there is no reason to trust administration. Branden Wolner says the more certain Bush claims to be, the more likely it is that he is wrong. Lee Shahinian Jr says Iran can not be expected to sit passively by with American troops on their eastern and western borders. Richard Dickens finds it ironic that Bush would hold Iran 's leadership responsible for bad things happening in Iraq whether it ordered them or not. Adam Hyams doubts if Congress will ever engage in true debate about Iraq (Francis X Clines 's Feb 15 Editorial Notebook). Iran, Iraq\n",

Gates Says U.S. Has Few Options to Halt Iran's Atomic Plans: Commodore Keith Winstanley of Britain, who is second in command of coalition naval forces in the region, told reporters at a briefing on Thursday that the carrier deployment should not be seen entirely as a move aimed at intimidating Iran , but he added,'' I 'm sure there 's a message there for Iran .'' Mr. Gates, who also met with the top American Navy and Air Force commanders in the region, said the deployments were meant to show that, for all its problems in Iraq , the United States could still fulfill its security commitments in the Persian Gulf.

I think they trained from scratch the model because they represent the triples in a \"non natural\" way (differently from [5]): BarackObama HasChild LivesIn OfficialLanguage [MASK].

Also, I think it's important to consider walks on the graph instead of single triples, because some useful information arises in these traversals at lengths higher than one (2) (random walks? maximum length?). Moreover, I think it would be convenient to sample sentences for multiple related entities (entity tuples from TESA). By this way, the self-attentions could relate similar terms in the sentences for the entities of TESA, and I think it's better suited for the final objective of learning knowledge that relates multiple entities (inductive bias about known related entities) (3).\n",

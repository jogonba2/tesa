As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Some City Jobs Top Off Salary With Pension: In Mr. Horn 's case, the mayor did not mention conducting a job search, but simply cited his recent experience running the two departments. Beyond the waivers, Mr. Bloomberg has also gone to unusual lengths to allow Mr. Horn and the sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty , to collect pensions while they are still working. John J.

      "Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías ; 28 July 1954 – 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who was president of Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela , which he led until 2012. Manuel J. Rosales, Jr., is an American organ builder whose instruments display a strong synthesis of romantic and contemporary styles. His workshop has built over 30 pipe organs with his notable output including collaborations on the instruments at Walt Disney Concert Hall and Rice University. Venezuela Groups Get U.S. Aid Amid Meddling Charges: He echoed recent comments from other high-ranking officials and from Mr. Chávez , who has a double-digit lead in most polls over his main opponent , Manuel Rosales , the governor of Zulia State . Mr. Chávez rarely refers in public to Mr. Rosales by name, instead framing his campaign as a choice between his government and the Bush administration. Hugo Chavez, Manuel J. Rosales\n",

      "Ehud Olmert ; born 30 September 1945) is an Israeli politician and lawyer. He served as the 12th Prime Minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009 and before that as a cabinet minister from 1988 to 1992 and from 2003 to 2006. Between his first and second stints as a cabinet member, he served as mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003. After serving as PM he was sentenced to serve a prison term over convictions for accepting bribes and for obstruction of justice during his terms as mayor of Jerusalem and as trade minister. Tzipi Malka Livni מלכה לבני; pronounced [tsipoˈʁa malˈka \"tsipi\" livni] born 8 July 1958) is an Israeli politician, diplomat, and lawyer. A former member of the Knesset and leader in the center-left political camp, Livni is a former Foreign Minister of Israel, Vice Prime Minister, Minister of Justice, and Leader of the Opposition. She is known for her efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israeli Foreign Minister Says She Asked Olmert to Resign: Ms. Livni , 48, is a popular but austere figure, and her statement was hardly a clarion call to rebellion. Mr. Olmert must make his own decision, she said, But her defection was the biggest blow so far to his chances of hanging on to office, and it lays down a clear marker that she will fight to replace him inside the party. Ehud Olmert, Tzipi Livni\n",

Testimony by a Former Times Reporter Is Challenged: She was followed to the witness stand by Matthew Cooper , a former Time magazine reporter who, unlike Ms. Miller , avoided going to jail by agreeing earlier to testify to the grand jury. Mr. Cooper testified Wednesday that Mr. Libby discussed Ms. Wilson during a telephone interview on July 12. He also recounted how he first learned about Ms. Wilson on July 11 from Karl Rove , the president 's chief political strategist . Judith Miller, Karl Rove, Matthew Cooper\n",

      "Howard Lloyd Weitzman is an American entertainment lawyer, active in matters ranging from intellectual property and entertainment issues to family law and estate issues. He's notable for representing Michael Jackson's estate in the IRS case against him. Other famous clients include Justin Bieber, O.J. Simpson and John DeLorean.Weitzman is a founding partner at Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert , a boutique litigation firm in Santa Monica, California. Martha Stark is an American politician, formerly the Finance Commissioner of New York City. A tax attorney, she served as Finance Commissioner in the Cabinet of Mayor Michael Bloomberg from 2002 until 2009. She previously worked for the Manhattan Borough President, served as a White House Fellow at the United States Department of State and for the Finance Department before becoming commissioner. Sheldon Silver is a former lawyer, Democratic Party politician from New York City and convicted felon who served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1994 until 2015. State Panel Selects 3 Likely Comptrollers: Mr. Weitzman is the comptroller of Nassau County , and Ms. Stark is the commissioner of the New York City Department of Finance. The third finalist is William J. Mulrow, an investment banker who ran for comptroller in 2002 and who is close to Gov. Eliot Spitzer. The panel resulted from an agreement between Mr. Silver and Governor Spitzer, who had originally sought a fiscal expert for comptroller but later softened that stance, saying he would be open to a lawmaker.

      "Context:\n",
      "Patrick Moses Dorismond was a security guard and father of two children who was killed by undercover New York City Police Department officers during the early morning of March 16, 2000. He was the younger brother of Bigga Haitian. Sean Bell was shot in the New York City borough of Queens, New York, United States, on November 25, 2006. Three men were shot when a total of 50 rounds were fired by a team of both plainclothes and undercover NYPD officers. Sean Bell was killed on the morning before his wedding, and two of his friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were severely wounded. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from members of the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Police Shooting Reunites Circle of Common Loss: In addition to his son, 13-year-old Nicholas Heyward Jr., who was playing with a toy gun when he was killed by a housing officer in Brooklyn, recent victims of violent encounters with the police included Amadou Diallo, killed in a hail of 41 bullets in the Bronx; Malcolm Ferguson, a drug suspect whose death came only five days after officers were acquitted in Mr. Diallo 's death; Gidone Busch, a mentally ill man killed by the police in Brooklyn; Patrick Dorismond , killed by an undercover narcotics detective in Manhattan; and Sean Bell , killed in Queens when five undercover detectives opened fire on his car. In the days before Mr. Bell 's funeral, the anguished club 's grapevine was in full operation: Mrs. Dorismond heard, but was not positive, that Mrs. Diallo, whose son was killed in 1999, would come from Maryland.

      "Context:\n",
      "Jane Margaret Lakes Harman is the former U.S. Representative for California's 36th congressional district, serving from 1993 to 1999, and from 2001 to 2011; she is a member of the Democratic Party. Harman was the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and the Homeland Security Committee's intelligence subcommittee. When Democrats held the House majority, she was in line to chair the House intelligence committee but was denied the post by then-Speaker Pelosi. Report Spells Out Favors By Former Congressman: Congressional investigation report shows that former Rep Randy Cunningham pressured and intimidated staff members of House Intelligence Committee to help steer more than$ 70 million in classified contracts to favored military contractors, repeatedly abusing his position to authorize spending that staff found wasteful. Finds that staff supported his growing requests for controversial Pentagon counterintelligence program despite numerous red flags over three years. Lays out Cunningham 's maneuvers inside classified world of committee to win secret contracts for Brent R Wilkes and Mitchell J Wade. Report made public by Democrat Jane Harman is new embarrassment for Congresssional Republicans three weeks before Election Day. Harman says she pushed for months to release findings of outside counsel Michael Stern. Report also cites Wilkes 's ties to former CIA administrator Kyle Foggo, who is under federal investigation in San Diego. Cunningham is serving prison sentence for bribery.

      "David Howell Petraeus  is a retired United States Army general and public official. He served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from September 6, 2011, until his resignation on November 9, 2012. Prior to his assuming the directorship of the CIA, Petraeus served 37 years in the United States Army. His last assignments in the Army were as commander of the International Security Assistance Force and George William Casey Jr. is a four-star general who served as the 36th Chief of Staff of the United States Army from April 10, 2007, to April 10, 2011. Casey served as Commanding General, Multi-National Force – Iraq, from June 2004 to February 8, 2007, and was in the army for his entire adult working life. He now resides in Arlington, Virginia. New Boss Takes Reins of U.S. Forces in Iraq: Gen David H Petraeus formally takes command of American troops in Iraq, succeeding Gen George W Casey Jr , who will become Army 's chief of staff. Casey had pushed for speedy transfer of control to Iraqi forces so American troops could withdraw, but Petraeus is expert in counterinsurgency and supports more active American role. American military officers consider Petraeus imaginative leader with deep understanding of Iraq 's problems from two tours of duty there. David H. Petraeus, George W. Casey Jr.\n",

      "Junichiro Koizumi ʑɯɰ̃.itɕiɾoː]; born 8 January 1942) is a Japanese politician who was Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party from 2001 to 2006. He retired from politics in 2009, and he remains the sixth-longest serving Prime Minister in Japanese history.Widely seen as a maverick leader of the LDP upon his election to the position in 2001, he became known as an economic reformer, focusing on reducing Japan's government debt and the privatisation of its postal service. Shinzō Abe zoː]; born 21 September 1954) is a Japanese politician who has been Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party since 2012. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007 and Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006. In late August 2019, Abe surpassed his great-uncle, Eisaku Satō, to become the second-longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, and the longest-serving Prime Minister in post-war Japan. Japan's Leaders Rigged Voter Forums, a Government Report Says: But a government report released Wednesday concluded that two-thirds of the town meetings organized by the Japanese government since 2001 were Soviet-style performances with people paid to ask planted questions -- favorable to the government. The report was the latest blow for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , whose approval ratings have plummeted to below 50 percent because he has backed off on political and economic changes undertaken by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi .

      "Anthony Pellicano is a former high-profile Los Angeles private investigator, known as a Hollywood fixer. He notably served a term of thirty months in a federal prison for illegal possession of explosives, firearms and homemade grenades. In 2008, he began serving an additional sentence for subsequent convictions for other crimes, including racketeering and wiretapping. Kerkor \"Kirk\" Kerkorian was an Armenian American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. He was the president and CEO of Tracinda Corporation, his private holding company based in Beverly Hills, California. Kerkorian was one of the important figures in the shaping of Las Vegas and, with architect Martin Stern, Jr. described as the \"father of the mega-resort\". He built the world's largest hotel in Las Vegas three times: the International Hotel , the MGM Grand Hotel and the MGM Grand . Lawyer Gave Information To Kerkorian: Attorney Terry N Christensen says he gave Kirk Kerkorian information regarding his ex-wife obtained from wiretaps used by Hollywood private detective Anthony Pellicano . Kerkorian has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is unlikely to be held criminally liable. Christensen was indicted last February in federal investigation of Pellicano .

He is nicknamed Il Cavaliere for his Order of Merit for Labour, although he voluntarily resigned from this order in March 2014. A Look at Italian Politics, A Peek at American Films: Beguiled by an attractive young screenwriter (Jasmine Trinca), Bruno decides to make an anti-Berlusconi picture (also called'' The Caiman ,'' which is more or less a synonym for crocodile), and encounters various obstacles, ranging from the skepticism of financiers and the unreliability of actors to his own temperamental befuddlement. After all, he admits at one point, he was a Berlusconi voter. Nanni Moretti, Silvio Berlusconi\n",

      "Sean Bell was shot in the New York City borough of Queens, New York, United States, on November 25, 2006. Three men were shot when a total of 50 rounds were fired by a team of both plainclothes and undercover NYPD officers. Sean Bell was killed on the morning before his wedding, and two of his friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were severely wounded. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from members of the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Testimony To Be Heard On Shooting By the Police: Mr. Hardy, lawyers representing some of the five officers involved in the shooting and others said they expected the grand jury 's work would last at least three weeks. The two men wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting , Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman , intend to testify, said Mr. Hardy, and will most likely do so toward the end of the grand jury process.''

      "Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry was the 20th Chief Justice of Pakistan, who served over three non-consecutive terms from 29 June 2005 to 11 December 2013. Syed Pervez Musharraf is a Pakistani politician and retired four-star general of the Pakistan Army, who was the 10th President of Pakistan from 2001 until tendering his resignation, to avoid impeachment, in 2008.Born in Delhi during the British Raj, Musharraf was raised in Karachi and Istanbul. He went on to study mathematics at the Forman Christian College in Lahore and would later study at the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1991. Musharraf Finds Himself Weakened After Firing of Judge Stirs Anger in Pakistan: He called the firing of Mr. Chaudhry '' the last straw.'' Shamshad Ahmad, who served in General Musharraf 's government as Pakistan 's ambassador to the United Nations, warned of'' despair and disillusionment'' among Pakistanis, in a stinging opinion piece in the conservative newspaper Nation on Saturday.'' Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, Pervez Musharraf\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Anthony Pellicano is a former high-profile Los Angeles private investigator, known as a Hollywood fixer. He notably served a term of thirty months in a federal prison for illegal possession of explosives, firearms and homemade grenades. In 2008, he began serving an additional sentence for subsequent convictions for other crimes, including racketeering and wiretapping. David Michael Hasselhoff , nicknamed \"The Hoff\", is an American actor, singer, producer, and businessman, who set a Guinness World Record as the most watched man on TV. Keith Ian Carradine is an American actor, singer and songwriter who has had success on stage, film and television. He is known for his roles as Tom Frank in Robert Altman's Nashville, Wild Bill Hickok in the HBO series Deadwood, FBI agent Frank Lundy in Dexter and US President Conrad Dalton in Madam Secretary. In addition, he is a Golden Globe- and Academy Award-winning songwriter. As a member of the Carradine family, he is part of an acting dynasty that began with his father, John Carradine. Sandra Will Carradine is an American film and television actress. She was formerly married to actor-singer-songwriter Keith Carradine, and around the time of their separation she became involved with Anthony Pellicano, a high-profile Hollywood private investigator who was involved in extensive illegal wiretapping activities. In 2006, she pleaded guilty to perjury for lying under oath about her awareness of Pellicano's wiretapping of Keith Carradine's phone. Arts, Briefly: Keith Carradine is suing Anthony Pellicano , the detective who was charged last month in the huge wiretapping scandal that has preoccupied Hollywood for months. In the complaint, filed Friday, Mr. Carradine contends that the detective conspired with Mr. Carradine 's ex-wife , Sandra Carradine , to eavesdrop on his conversations illegally. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order against the former'' Baywatch'' star David Hasselhoff , requiring him to stay at least 100 yards away from his estranged wife, Pamela Bach, according to court papers unsealed last week. Anthony Pellicano, David Hasselhoff, Keith Carradine, Sandra Carradine\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Deborah D. Pryce is an American politician from Ohio who was the member of the United States House of Representatives for Ohio's 15th congressional district, which includes the western half of Columbus and the surrounding suburbs, from 1993 to 2009. She is a Republican. Mary Jo Kilroy is the former U.S. Representative for Ohio's 15th congressional district, serving from 2009 until 2011. She is a member of the Democratic Party from Ohio. In her first term she introduced a bill to lend $20 million per year to small businesses and an amendment to assign liability to credit reporting agencies. She also contributed to legislation on executive pay. She was defeated in her November 2, 2010 re-election bid. Foley Case Snags Incumbent In Ohio Race for House Seat: But nowhere else has it become quite as pitched as here, where Ms. Kilroy -- who had already been trying to link Ms. Pryce to corruption scandals in Ohio involving Republicans -- has moved in with withering attacks since Mr. Foley resigned. In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Kilroy questioned whether Ms. Pryce had had any warning about Mr. Foley 's conduct, and why Ms. Pryce , the No. 4 Republican in the House, had not called for the resignation of Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois as speaker.'' Deborah Pryce, Mary Jo Kilroy\n",

      "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger is an Austrian-American politician, actor, filmmaker, businessman, author, and former professional bodybuilder. He served as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. As of 2019, he is the most recent Republican governor of California. Hermann Maier is an Austrian former World Cup champion alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist. Nicknamed the \"Herminator\", Maier ranks among the greatest alpine ski racers in history, with four overall World Cup titles , two Olympic gold medals , and three World Championship titles . His 54 World Cup race victories – 24 super-G, 15 downhills, 14 giant slaloms, and 1 combined – rank third on the men's all-time list behind Ingemar Stenmark's 86 victories and Marcel Hirscher's 68 victories. Herminator Encourages Governator: I told him I believe for sure he will have a great comeback.'' In the late 1990s, Maier 's aggressive skiing and seemingly indestructible body earned him the nickname the Herminator, a play on the title of Schwarzenegger 's most famous action-movie character, the Terminator.

      "Context:\n",
      "Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa were former New York City Police Department police detectives who worked on behalf of the New York City Mafia, principally the Lucchese and Gambino crime families, while they committed various illegal activities. In 2006, they were convicted of labor racketeering, extortion, narcotics, illegal gambling, obstruction of justice, eight counts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, charges stemming from the 1980s and the early 1990s in New York City, and in the 2000s in Las Vegas. Both were sentenced to life in federal prison. With the Jury Out, Trivia and Tall Tales Fill the Down Time: Much of this concerned the case, of course, in which the two defendants, retired New York City police detectives, are accused of using their detectives' shields to murder for the mob. As the armchair analysts assessed the odds, Mr. Caracappa sat intently in the courtroom while Mr. Eppolito sat, for a while, in the courthouse snack shop with a Diet Pepsi and the Wonderword puzzle from The New York Post. Louis J. Eppolito, Stephen Caracappa\n",

      "Fred Ebb was an American musical theatre lyricist who had many successful collaborations with composer John Kander. The Kander and Ebb team frequently wrote for such performers as Liza Minnelli and Chita Rivera. John Harold Kander is the American composer of a number of musicals as part of the songwriting team of Kander and Ebb. His best-known stage musicals as composer are Cabaret and Chicago, both of which were later adapted into films. Joseph Stein was an American playwright best known for writing the books for such musicals as Fiddler on the Roof and Zorba. Historical Mayhem, Set to Music: At the same time, she 's demonstrating that there is indeed a good reason for'' All About Us,'' the musical version of Thornton Wilder 's apocalyptic comedy'' The Skin of Our Teeth'' that runs at Westport through April 28. Until Ms. Kitt unleashes her incomparable hooch act, it 's not exactly clear why the musical theater royalty responsible for'' All About Us'' -- the author of'' Fiddler on the Roof,'' Joseph Stein , and the songwriters behind'' Cabaret'' and'' Chicago,'' John Kander and Fred Ebb -- felt so strongly about this material that they shaped it into a musical in 1999 and then kept revisiting it.

      "Jack O'Brien is an American director, producer, writer and lyricist. He served as the Artistic Director of the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California from 1981 through the end of 2007.O'Brien has won three Tony Awards and been nominated for seven more, and won five Drama Desk Awards. Sir Tom Stoppard  is a Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter. He has written prolifically for TV, radio, film and stage, finding prominence with plays such as Arcadia, The Coast of Utopia, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Professional Foul, The Real Thing, Travesties, The Invention of Love, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. He co-wrote the screenplays for Brazil, The Russia House, and Shakespeare in Love, and has received an Academy Award and four Tony Awards. History's Sweep, In Words And Silence: That 's Mr. Stoppard 's sublimely theatrical way of admitting that words, his beloved stock in trade, ultimately do n't count for much in the course of human events. Many of his characters come to the same conclusion in'' Shipwreck,'' which is directed by Jack O'Brien with the same seductive vividness he brought to the trilogy 's first part,'' Voyage,'' which opened last month .

      "Paul Dundes Wolfowitz is an American political scientist and diplomat who served as the 10th President of the World Bank, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, and former dean of Johns Hopkins SAIS. He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, working on issues of international economic development, Africa and public-private partnerships, and chairman of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council.He is considered to be a leading neoconservative. Shaha Riza , is a Libyan former World Bank employee. Her external assignment at the Foundation for the Future, a \"semi-independent foundation to promote democracy\" is both in the Middle East and in North Africa. Committee Is Likely to Say Wolfowitz Broke the Rules: Mr. Wolfowitz 's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said he hoped that the board would acknowledge that whatever happened, the bank president had sincerely tried to do the right thing and arranged for the pay increase only after consulting widely. Mr. Bennett also said he would submit a detailed rebuttal of the recollections of two top officials who testified to the special committee this week that, contrary to Mr. Wolfowitz 's recollection, they had not approved all aspects of Ms. Riza 's compensation arrangements.''

      "François Bayrou is a French centrist politician and the president of the Democratic Movement , who was a candidate in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 French presidential elections. Nicolas Paul Stéphane Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa ; born 28 January 1955) is a retired French politician who served as President of France and ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra from 16 May 2007 until 15 May 2012. Ségolène Royal ; born 22 September 1953), is a French politician and former Socialist Party candidate for President of France. Street Violence by Paris Youths Intrudes Again Into French Politics: The Socialist candidate , Ségolène Royal , who is running second in the opinion polls, said the incident showed that Mr. Sarkozy had failed as interior minister.'' In five years with a right-wing government that has made crime its main campaign issue, you can see that it is a failure all the way,'' she said on Canal+ television. François Bayrou , a centrist presidential candidate , also took aim at Mr. Sarkozy , saying,'' It is very important to end this climate of perpetual confrontation between police and some citizens.'' Francois Bayrou, Nicolas Sarkozy, Segolene Royal\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko was a British naturalised Russian defector and former officer of the Russian FSB secret service who specialised in tackling organized crime. According to US diplomats, Litvinenko coined the phrase Mafia state. In November 1998, Litvinenko and several other FSB officers publicly accused their superiors of ordering the assassination of the Russian tycoon and oligarch Boris Berezovsky. Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky is an exiled Russian businessman, philanthropist and former oligarch, now residing in London. In 2003, Khodorkovsky was believed to be the wealthiest man in Russia, with a fortune estimated to be worth $15 billion, and was ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires. He had worked his way up the Komsomol apparatus, during the Soviet years, and started several businesses during the period of glasnost and perestroika in the late 1980s. Moscow Links Poisoning Inquiry to Yukos Case: It singled out Leonid B. Nevzlin, a major shareholder and partner of the company 's jailed chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky . The statement did not elaborate on any evidence that might link Mr. Nevzlin and others to Mr. Litvinenko 's death, which was caused by a high dose of a radioactive material, polonium 210.

      "Context:\n",
      "Joseph Levitch , better known by his stage name Jerry Lewis, was an American comedian, actor, singer, filmmaker and humanitarian and dubbed as \"The King of Comedy\" and \"The Total Filmmaker\". Lewis gained his career breakthrough with fellow singer Dean Martin, billed as Martin & Lewis, in 1946 and would perform together for ten years until an acrimonious break up of the partnership in 1956.  Rise of Capitol Lobbyist Shines A Light on House Connections: Now, Ms. White 's success has drawn less welcome attention. Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. Lewis and other lawmakers may have traded earmarks for illicit payments from lobbyists and contractors -- an outgrowth of the bribery indictment of Randy Cunningham , a former congressman from California.

      "John Mondy Shimkus is an American politician currently serving as the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 15th congressional district. He has served in the House since 1997, and is a member of the Republican Party. On August 30, 2019, Shimkus announced that he will not seek re-election for his seat in 2020. Mark Adam Foley is a former member of the United States House of Representatives. He served from 1995 until 2006, representing the 16th District of Florida as a member of the Republican Party, before resigning due to revelations that he had sent sexually explicit messages to teenaged boys who had served as congressional pages. No Early Foley Complaints, Head of Pages Says: I had no reason to believe there was n't changed behavior,'' Mr. Shimkus said.'' We would always do an end-of-the-year` bye-bye' to the pages on the House floor, but Congressman Foley did not show this year. John Shimkus, Mark Foley\n",

      "Robert Troy is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who has been a Teachta Dála for the Longford–Westmeath constituency since the 2011 general election.From Ballynacargy, County Westmeath, he was elected as a Teachta Dála for the Longford–Westmeath constituency at the 2011 general election, beating the two sitting Fianna Fáil TDs, Peter Kelly and former cabinet Minister and Leader of the Seanad Mary O'Rourke. He was a member of Westmeath County Council for the Mullingar West electoral area from 2004 to 2011. Police Chief Places Blame For Deaths of Two Officers: The chief of the Jersey City Police Department blamed state transportation officials on Friday for the deaths of two officers who drove off an open vertical lift bridge, saying that the bridge was in chronic disrepair and that the operators compounded the danger by failing to tell the officers exactly when the deck was going to be raised. Chief Robert A. Troy delivered a minute-by-minute report of the Christmas night accident, from the first businesslike call that the bridge needed to be lifted for a passing tugboat to the final grief-streaked radio transmissions made seconds after Officers Shawn Carson and Robert Nguyen plunged into the frigid waters of the Hackensack River.''

His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era. A Genius Finds Inspiration In the Music of Another: He also empathized with Mozart 's ability to continue to compose magnificent music even in very difficult and impoverished conditions. In 1905, the year he discovered relativity, Einstein was living in a cramped apartment and dealing with a difficult marriage and money troubles. Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Alan G. Hevesi is a former American politician and convicted felon who served as a New York State Assemblyman from 1971–93, as New York City Comptroller from 1994-2001, and as New York State Comptroller from 2003-06. Hevesi is originally from Queens, New York City.A member of the Democratic Party, Hevesi was first elected State Comptroller in 2002 and won re-election in 2006. However, he resigned from office effective December 22, 2006 as part of a plea bargain with the Albany County Court which related to his unlawful use of state employees to care for his ailing wife. Joseph Louis Bruno is an American businessman and Republican politician from upstate New York. Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Calls Increase From Both Parties for Hevesi to Step Down: Let 's let this process play out free of partisan rhetoric.'' Mr. Hevesi 's campaign declined to comment on the day 's events. Alan G. Hevesi, Joseph L. Bruno\n",

      "Azmi Bishara is an Arab public intellectual, political philosopher and author. is presently the General Director of the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies and the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.Born in Nazareth in Israel, his political activity began when he founded the National Committee for Arab High School Students in 1974. He later established the Arab Students Union when at university. Ehud Olmert ; born 30 September 1945) is an Israeli politician and lawyer. He served as the 12th Prime Minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009 and before that as a cabinet minister from 1988 to 1992 and from 2003 to 2006. Between his first and second stints as a cabinet member, he served as mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003. After serving as PM he was sentenced to serve a prison term over convictions for accepting bribes and for obstruction of justice during his terms as mayor of Jerusalem and as trade minister. Micha Lindenstrauss  was an Israeli judge and the State Comptroller between 2005 and 2012. Israeli Premier Accused of Impropriety in Previous Post: According to the allegations , Mr. Bishara personally received large sums of money from abroad,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. Under Israeli law, the suspicions against Mr. Bishara , who resigned from Parliament on Sunday and is currently abroad, amount to treason. The state comptroller 's report suggested that Mr. Olmert had been involved in procuring investment opportunities for an associate while he was in office as trade and industry minister, starting in 2003. Azmi Bishara, Ehud Olmert, Micha Lindenstrauss\n",

      "Viktor Andriyovych Yushchenko ; born 23 February 1954) is a Ukrainian politician who was the third President of Ukraine from 23 January 2005 to 25 February 2010. Yulia Volodymyrivna Tymoshenko ; born 27 November 1960) is a Ukrainian politician. After Vote, Ukraine Faces Uncertainty Over Coalition: The results underscored the fractured nature of Ukraine 's ethnic, social and geographic divisions, as well as the remarkable erosion of support for Mr. Yushchenko , whose popularity has suffered from economic decline and infighting. In a sign of the bitterness between him and Ms. Tymoshenko , one of her advisers, Hryhory M. Nemyrya, said that Ms. Tymoshenko had called the president after surveys of voters leaving the polls predicted her second-place finish, but that he had not returned the call. Instead, Mr. Yushchenko 's office announced in a terse statement that he would meet with the leaders of all the major parties on Tuesday, leaving open the possibility of a coalition that could include Mr. Yanukovich but exclude his erstwhile ally.

      "Context:\n",
      "Richard Bruce Cheney is an American politician and businessman who served as the 46th vice president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He has been cited as the most powerful vice president in American history. He was also one of the most unpopular politicians in the history of the US, holding an approval rating of just 13% at the time of leaving office.Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Casper, Wyoming. He attended Yale and then the University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby is an American lawyer and former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti was President of Iraq from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003. A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later, the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization the Iraqi Ba'ath Party—which espoused Ba'athism, a mix of Arab nationalism and socialism—Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup that brought the party to power in Iraq. Iraq Findings Leaked by Aide Were Disputed: The assertion about the aide , I. Lewis Libby Jr. , was based on a court filing last Wednesday by Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor overseeing the indictment of Mr. Libby in the C.I.A. leak case. Yesterday, Mr. Fitzgerald filed a letter with the court correcting his original filing to say Mr. Libby had been authorized to disclose'' some of the key judgments of the N.I.E., and that the N.I.E. stated that Iraq was vigorously trying to procure uranium.'' This revised account of his filing undercut a basis of the Times article -- that Mr. Libby testified that he had been told to overstate the significance of the intelligence about uranium .

      "Context:\n",
      "Alan Alda is an American actor, director, screenwriter, comedian, and author. A six-time Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award winner, he played Hawkeye Pierce in the war television series M*A*S*H . He has had recurring roles on television programs such as The West Wing, and 30 Rock, and has appeared in films such as Same Time, Next Year , The Four Seasons , Crimes and Misdemeanors , Bridge of Spies , and Marriage Story . Jimmy Smits is an Emmy Award-winning, American actor best known for playing attorney Victor Sifuentes on the 1980s legal drama L.A. Law, NYPD Detective Bobby Simone on the 1990s police drama NYPD Blue and Matt Santos on the 1999–2006 serial political drama The West Wing. He also appeared as Bail Organa in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and as ADA Miguel Prado in Dexter. From 2012 to 2014, he joined the main cast of Sons of Anarchy as Nero Padilla. Smits currently portrays Elijah Strait in the NBC drama series Bluff City Law. Lawrence Francis O'Donnell Jr. is an American television pundit, actor, and host of The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, an MSNBC opinion and news program, airing weeknights. As a political commentator, O'Donnell has a history of hard-edged comments and controversial statements for which he has had to issue retractions. On 'West Wing,' May the Saddest Man Win: But the reversal of fortune for Matt Santos -- the Democratic nominee, played by Jimmy Smits , who was the victor -- had nothing to do with any shift in opinion among voters. Instead, Lawrence O'Donnell , an executive producer of the show , said he and his fellow writers had declared Santos the winner only after the death, in mid-December, of John Spencer , who portrayed Santos 's running mate, Leo McGarry. At the time of Mr. Spencer 's death, the plot for last night 's episode had been set: the election was to be won by Alan Alda 's Arnold Vinick, a maverick Republican (modeled a bit on Senator John McCain), whom many Democrats (including the Democrats who write the show) could learn to love.

      "Context:\n",
      "Harry Mason Reid is a retired American attorney and politician who served as a United States Senator from Nevada from 1987 to 2017. He led the Senate's Democratic Conference from 2005 to 2017 and was the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015. Steny Hamilton Hoyer is an American attorney and politician serving as U.S. Representative for Maryland's 5th congressional district since 1981 and as House Majority Leader since 2019. A Democrat, he was first elected in a special election on May 19, 1981, and is currently serving in his 20th term. The district includes a large swath of rural and suburban territory southeast of Washington, D.C. Hoyer is the dean of the Maryland Congressional delegation, and the most senior Democrat in the House. Democrats Split Over Their Approach to Iraq: Democratic majority in Congress is divided over how to assert its power in opposing Pres Bush 's plan to send more troops to Baghdad. Sen Edward M Kennedy says he will introduce legislation to block spending for troop increase and require president to gain new Congressional authority before sending more troops. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggests Democrats consider blocking financing for troop increase, and Sen Harry Reid , majority leader , vows to take look at it. House majority leader , Rep Steny H Hoyer , has yet to endorse idea, and other Democrats have distanced themselves from such a proposal, fearing it will cast them as opposing troops.

      "William Jefferson Clinton is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. George Walker Bush is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He had previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Bush is frequently referred to as George W. Bush, Bush Junior, or Bush 43 to distinguish him from his father, George H. W. Bush, who served as the 41st president from 1989 to 1993.  Two Ex-Presidents, Often Allies, Are Divided by a Senate Race: Appearances by former Presidents George H W Bush and Bill Clinton , often allies for various causes, at separate fund-raisers in New Jersey underscore significance of increasingly contentious race for United States Senate. Bush spoke for Republican nominee, State Sen Thomas H Kean Jr at event in Bridgewater, and Clinton attended event in Elizabeth for Sen Robert Menendez. Bill Clinton, George Bush\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Rudolph William Louis Giuliani is an American politician, attorney, and public speaker who served as the 107th Mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001. He currently acts as an attorney to President Donald Trump. Politically a Democrat, then an Independent in the 1970s, and a Republican since the 1980s, Giuliani served as United States Associate Attorney General from 1981 to 1983. Malcolm Stevenson \"Steve\" Forbes Jr. is an American publishing executive. Forbes was a candidate in the 1996 and 2000 Republican Presidential primaries. Forbes is the Editor-in-Chief of Forbes, a business magazine. Forbes is the son of longtime Forbes publisher Malcolm Forbes, and the grandson of that publication's founder, B.C. Forbes. He is an adviser at the Forbes School of Business & Technology. As Forbes Endorses Giuliani, Giuliani Endorses a Flat Tax: You 're giving them more authority, more autonomy, and you 're giving them less resources to deal with the problems,'' he said then in an interview with CBS, calling the proposal'' a mistake.'' He used stronger language on CNN a few days later, saying the Forbes plan'' would really be a disaster.'' Rudolph W. Giuliani, Steve Forbes\n",

      "Andrés Alonso was the chief executive officer of the Baltimore City Public School System in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Alonso came to Baltimore from the New York City Public School system in July 2007. He had been deputy chancellor in New York for the year prior to his appointment in Baltimore. Carmen Fariña is a former New York City Schools Chancellor, head of the New York City Department of Education, announced Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio on December 30, 2013; the first Chancellor to have had schools supervision training and experience since Board of Education chancellor Rudy Crew. Joel Irwin Klein is an American lawyer and school superintendent. He was the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States, serving more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. He was succeeded by Cathie Black in January 2011. Michael Rubens Bloomberg KBE is an American businessman, politician, author, and philanthropist. As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Top School Aide Becomes the Latest to Step Down: Carmen Fariña , the top instructional official in the New York City public schools and a bulldozing force in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg 's remaking of the system, will retire at the end of the school year, Chancellor Joel I. Klein announced yesterday. Ms. Fariña , the deputy chancellor of teaching and learning, who turned 63 this month, said she wanted more time with her family, including her husband, who is retired, and her two grandchildren. She has worked in the city school system for more than 40 years, as a teacher, principal and superintendent. Her successor is her chief of staff, Andrés Alonso , 48, a graduate of Harvard Law School who left corporate law to teach special education and bilingual students in Newark for 11 years.

      "Context:\n",
      "Alberto R. Gonzales is an American lawyer who served as the 82nd United States Attorney General, appointed in February 2005 by President George W. Bush, becoming the highest-ranking Hispanic American in executive government to date. He was the first Hispanic to serve as White House Counsel. Earlier he had been Bush's General Counsel during his governorship of Texas. Gonzales had also served as Secretary of State of Texas and then as a Texas Supreme Court Justice. D. Kyle Sampson was the Chief of Staff and Counselor of United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He resigned on March 12, 2007, amid the controversy surrounding the firing of eight United States Attorneys in 2006 and was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing in July 2010. In October 2007, Sampson joined the law firm of Hunton & Williams LLP as a partner in the firm's food and drug practice, where his practice focuses on FDA regulatory and enforcement matters. Harriet Ellan Miers is an American lawyer who served as White House Counsel to President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007. A member of the Republican Party since 1988, she previously served as White House Staff Secretary from 2001 to 2003 and White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy from 2003 until 2005. In 2005, Miers was nominated by Bush to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, but—in the face of bipartisan opposition—asked Bush to withdraw her nomination. Gonzales Met With Advisers On Dismissals: His plan was sent to the White House on Nov. 15, according to previously released e-mail. Harriet E. Miers , the White House counsel at the time , approved Mr. Sampson 's proposal on Dec. 4, and the dismissals were carried out three days later. Alberto R. Gonzales, D. Kyle Sampson, Harriet E. Miers\n",

He is the first African American to serve as New York governor and the second legally blind governor of a U.S. state. Eliot Laurence Spitzer is an American politician, attorney, and educator. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 54th Governor of New York. Spitzer Names Harlem Senator To His Ticket: Does he regard Mr. Suozzi as a serious threat and thereby see lining up his running mate as a way to quickly unify the party around the ticket? Would one result be to swing attention in the attorney general 's race to an upstate Democratic candidate, Denise O'Donnell of Buffalo, a former prosecutor whom Mr. Spitzer is said to admire?

      "Robert Allan Caro is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of United States political figures Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson. Robert Moses was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban development in the United States. A Tale Of Two Cities: Co-op City, in the Bronx, was built on the site of the defunct Freedomland amusement park; Moses did not tear down tenements to make room for it. Correction: May 27, 2007, Sunday An article on May 6 about Robert Caro and his biography of Robert Moses referred imprecisely to Moses' role in Westway, a 1970s proposal for a superhighway and park development on the West Side of Manhattan.

      "Context:\n",
      "Herman Edwards Jr. is an American football coach and former player, as of 2018 the head coach at Arizona State University. From 2009 to 2017, he was a pro football analyst for ESPN. He played cornerback for ten seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams, and Atlanta Falcons. Edwards is known for the 1978 \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", where he recovered a fumble by Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik, for a touchdown during the waning seconds of a certain Eagles loss, to turn it into a victory. Robert Terrence \"Terry\" Bradway is an American football executive. He served as the general manager for the New York Jets of the National Football League from 2001 to 2006. Bradway worked in the personnel department for the Kansas City Chiefs prior to being hired as general manager of the Jets. In His Silence, Bradway Seems To Drop Hint: Because public speaking does not appear to be one of Bradway 's favorite things, he was happy to cede the spotlight over the last five years to Edwards, who became, by default, the face and voice of the organization.'' Herm did such a great job with you guys and sometimes we put him out there too much,'' Bradway said.'' Herman Edwards, Terry Bradway\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Harry Donald Carson is a former American football inside linebacker who played his entire professional career for the New York Giants of the National Football League . Carson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006. John Earl Madden is an American former football coach and sportscaster. He won a Super Bowl as head coach of the Oakland Raiders, and after retiring from coaching became a well-known color commentator for NFL telecasts. In 2006, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his coaching career. He is also widely known for the long-running Madden NFL video game series he has endorsed and fronted since 1988. Madden worked as a color analyst for all four major networks: CBS , Fox , ABC , and NBC . Larry Rayfield Wright is a former American football player, an offensive tackle for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League for thirteen seasons and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 2006.Nicknamed the \"Big Cat\" for his nimble feet, Wright played on five NFC Championship teams that advanced to the Super Bowl , winning twice. He also participated in the Ice Bowl against the Green Bay Packers for the NFL championship in his rookie season in 1967. Troy Kenneth Aikman is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League . The first overall pick of the 1989 NFL Draft, Aikman played twelve consecutive seasons as the starting quarterback with the Cowboys, the most number of seasons by any Cowboy quarterback. During his career he was a six-time Pro Bowl selection, led the team to three Super Bowl victories, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXVII. Carson Makes Hall at Last; Party Goes On Without Him: It 's only fitting that he puts the Hall of Fame on hold for a little bit,'' said Rich Eisen of the NFL Network, the master of ceremonies at the news conference. Aikman , Moon and White were selected by the 39 voters in their first year of eligibility. Madden and Wright each had been eligible more than 20 years, and were in their second year as nominees of the Hall 's senior committee. Harry Carson, John Madden, Rayfield Wright, Troy Aikman\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Atiku Abubakar  is a Nigerian politician, businessman, philanthropist and presidential candidate of the People's Democratic Party at the 2019 Nigerian general election. He served as the 11th vice-president of Nigeria from 1999 to 2007 under the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo.In 1998 he was elected Governor of Adamawa State. While still Governor-Elect, he was selected by then-presidential candidate Olusegun Obasanjo as his running mate. Chief Olusegun Mathew Okikiola Aremu Obasanjo, GCFR,  is a former Nigerian Army general who was President of Nigeria from 1999 to 2007. Obasanjo was a career soldier before serving twice as his nation's head of state: He served as a military ruler from 13 February 1976 to 1 October 1979 and as a democratically elected president from 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007. From July 2004 to January 2006, Obasanjo also served as Chairperson of the African Union. World Briefing | Africa: Nigeria: Court Says Vice President Can Stay: The ruling, which may be appealed, was the latest round in a legal battle between Nigeria 's most prominent politicians, who forged a strategic alliance eight years ago. The combination of Mr. Obasanjo , a Yoruba Christian from the south, and Mr. Abubakar , a Hausa Muslim from the north, was intended to cool the ethnic and sectarian flames of Nigeria and guide it peacefully from military rule to democracy.

      "Context:\n",
      "William Jefferson Clinton is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Lauren Pierce Bush is the CEO and Co-Founder of FEED Projects. She is also known for her previous career as a fashion model and designer. She is a daughter of Neil Bush and Sharon Bush , a granddaughter of former President George H. W. Bush and niece of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Bush and Frist Turn to Clinton for Help: One is Lauren Bush , a niece of President Bush , and the other is Harrison Frist, a son of Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader.'' We all flew around with all sorts of ideas and we just decided that President Clinton would be an awesome choice,'' said Christopher Lloyd, president of the class of 2006. Bill Clinton, Lauren Bush\n",

      "Robert L. Grenier is a longtime CIA officer who served as the CIA's top counter-terrorism official and was fired from that position by CIA director Porter Goss. Valerie Elise Plame Wilson , is an American writer, spy novelist, and former officer who worked at the United States Central Intelligence Agency . As the subject of the 2003 Plame affair, also known as the CIA leak scandal, Plame's identity as a CIA officer was leaked to and subsequently published by Robert Novak of the Washington Post. Ex-Officials Testify They Informed Libby of the Identity of a C.I.A. Operative: Mr. Grenier said he had not remembered that part of the conversation with Mr. Libby and only recalled it more than a year later when he went before a grand jury again. With a generous dollop of scorn, Mr. Jeffress asked why Mr. Grenier had first told the grand jury that he had no recollection of telling Mr. Libby about Ms. Wilson , only to change his story later.''

You 're not president yet, Mrs. Clinton ,'' her opponent , John Spencer , the former mayor of Yonkers , shot back, noting that Lincoln was the president, not a senator, when he made critical decisions about that war.

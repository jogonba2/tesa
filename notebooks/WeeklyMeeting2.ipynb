Airbus is registered in the Netherlands; its shares are traded in Germany, France and Spain. It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures aircraft in the European Union and various other countries. The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2017 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Airbus Hopes Its Planes, Not Its Setbacks, Will Stand Out: In July 2006, they unveiled the redesigned A350-XWB, with a wider fuselage, better fuel economy and more passenger comfort. Yet by the time the parent company of Airbus , European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company , gave Airbus the permission to market the new version of the plane in December, Boeing had secured nearly 450 orders for the competing 787, a number that has since risen to 584.

The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States. It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal and state court cases that involve a point of federal law, and original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, including suits between two or more states and those involving ambassadors. The Court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the U.S. Constitution. Supreme Court Refuses Case Challenging Group's Designation as Terrorists: The Supreme Court refused on Monday to intervene in the federal prosecution of seven Iranian refugees for providing financial support to an opposition group in Iran that the State Department has designated as a terrorist organization. The seven defendants, who are now all United States citizens, argue that they are constitutionally entitled to challenge the validity of that designation as part of their defense.

      "Airbus SE ; German: [ˈɛːɐ̯bʊs] ; Spanish: [ˈeiɾβus]) is a European multinational aerospace corporation that stood as the world's second biggest aerospace and defence company in 2018, behind only their primary competitor, Boeing. Airbus is registered in the Netherlands; its shares are traded in Germany, France and Spain. It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures aircraft in the European Union and various other countries. The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aerospace manufacturers; it is the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2017 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Airbus Hopes Its Planes, Not Its Setbacks, Will Stand Out: In July 2006, they unveiled the redesigned A350-XWB, with a wider fuselage, better fuel economy and more passenger comfort. Yet by the time the parent company of Airbus , European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company , gave Airbus the permission to market the new version of the plane in December, Boeing had secured nearly 450 orders for the competing 787, a number that has since risen to 584.

Arcelor Is Said to Plan Sale Of Stake as Buyout Defense: His Severstal group has holdings in autos, finance and metallurgy.

Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the President of Russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 until 2008. In between his presidential terms, he was also the Prime Minister of Russia under president Dmitry Medvedev. Post-Putin: Announcing one 's own candidacy is, in fact, tantamount to declaring one 's open opposition to the Kremlin, to the smooth transition of power, to Putin himself . Even the parliamentary opposition is wary of doing that. So far in this quasi-election season only two people have done it: a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and, improbably, Aleksandr V. Donskoi , the youthful mayor of Arkhangelsk, a small port city on the White Sea. Both promptly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors, even as the mass media piled on in the way they never do with today 's authorities, certainly not the likes of Putin , Ivanov or Medvedev .

      "William Jefferson Clinton is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Joseph Isadore Lieberman is an American politician, lobbyist and attorney who served as a United States Senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 election. During his final term in office he was officially listed as an independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party. Edward Miner Lamont Jr. is an American businessman and politician serving as the 89th governor of Connecticut since January 9, 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a Greenwich selectman from 1987 to 1989. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006, defeating incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman in the state Democratic primary election. Lamont Criticizes Lieberman's 1998 Rebuke of Clinton Over Affair: Senator Lieberman said what he believed. And many people believe that by making the statement he did, and separating the moral ramifications from any legal questions he helped defuse the case for impeachment to protect President Clinton 's presidency.'' As the two Senate candidates returned to Connecticut from Washington on Thursday, Mr. Lamont unveiled a new campaign commercial featuring a young man reading the names of several soldiers who were killed in the war in Iraq.

      "Barack Hussein Obama II ; born August 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Clinton Camp Challenges Obama on Iraq: Yet when it came later to hypothetical questioning about how he would have voted on the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Mr. Obama has been more circumspect. With the war a central issue in the campaign and with part of Mr. Obama 's appeal among Democrats rooted in his opposition, his stance and the question of whether he has been consistent are likely to be themes throughout his battle for the Democratic nomination, especially if Mr. Obama uses his position to suggest that Mrs. Clinton and other candidates failed to be sufficiently skeptical of the Bush administration.

First elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history. Speaker Pelosi Tempts Disaster: As incoming speaker, Ms. Pelosi will be dogged by skepticism -- from within the party and without -- about her political smarts and her ability to deliver a galvanized agenda. It was a no-brainer for the caucus to end the misguided fight for Mr. Murtha , who belittled the need for reform. John P. Murtha, Nancy Pelosi\n",

He retired from politics in 2009, and he remains the sixth-longest serving Prime Minister in Japanese history.Widely seen as a maverick leader of the LDP upon his election to the position in 2001, he became known as an economic reformer, focusing on reducing Japan's government debt and the privatisation of its postal service. Shinzō Abe zoː]; born 21 September 1954) is a Japanese politician who has been Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party since 2012. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2007 and Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2005 to 2006. In late August 2019, Abe surpassed his great-uncle, Eisaku Satō, to become the second-longest serving prime minister in Japanese history, and the longest-serving Prime Minister in post-war Japan. Japan's Leaders Rigged Voter Forums, a Government Report Says: But a government report released Wednesday concluded that two-thirds of the town meetings organized by the Japanese government since 2001 were Soviet-style performances with people paid to ask planted questions -- favorable to the government. The report was the latest blow for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , whose approval ratings have plummeted to below 50 percent because he has backed off on political and economic changes undertaken by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi .

Joseph Louis Bruno is an American businessman and Republican politician from upstate New York. Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Sheldon Silver is a former lawyer, Democratic Party politician from New York City and convicted felon who served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1994 until 2015. The Reform Window: His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O'Connell, the Republican, is government reform. Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer , Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce'' sweeping reforms'' of the way the state budget is put together. Eliot Spitzer, Joseph L.

Faso ran for New York State Comptroller in 2002 and for Governor of New York in 2006, but did not prevail in either race. William Floyd Weld is an American attorney, businessman, author, and Republican politician who served as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997. Weld is currently running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2020. Republican Says Weld Will Name Secretary of State as His Running Mate: In April, Gov. George E. Pataki named Mr. Jacobs to replace Randy A. Daniels as secretary of state . He was confirmed by the Senate this month, but it is unlikely that he will retain that job after Mr. Pataki leaves office at the end of the year. Last week, Mr. Weld 's opponent , John Faso , a former state assemblyman , chose C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, as his running mate. Christopher L. Jacobs, John J.

Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal.

He previously served as head of government relations and communications at Bloomberg L.P. and as chairman of Bloomberg Government.

He is credited with managing Mayor Bloomberg's three successful campaigns for Mayor of New York. Michael Rubens Bloomberg KBE is an American businessman, politician, author, and philanthropist. As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Strategist With Sharp Elbows Has Bloomberg Swinging Away: Kevin Sheekey , Mayor Michael R Bloomberg 's top political strategist and deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations, has gone on virtual war footing to make sure Bloomberg pushes through his agenda before he is forced to leave office in 2009 by term limits. Several officials upstate and downstate say they are watching to see whether Bloomberg benefits from his new aggressiveness or whether it backfires to damage city 's relations with its partners in government. Joseph L Bruno , Senate majority leader , has expressed displeasure with new tone from City Hall, but Sheekey is unbowed. Joseph L. Bruno, Kevin Sheekey, Michael R. Bloomberg\n",

A number of museums and architectural centres have presented retrospectives of his work. A Vision in the Desert: Mr. Nouvel also envisions the art spilling out onto the alleyways and courtyards, from sculpture to mosaics. Mr. Gehry 's Guggenheim, planned for a choice site at the tip of the island, is also conceived as a series of galleries loosely arranged around open-air courtyards, a bit like a souk.

      "Anthony Pellicano is a former high-profile Los Angeles private investigator, known as a Hollywood fixer. He notably served a term of thirty months in a federal prison for illegal possession of explosives, firearms and homemade grenades. In 2008, he began serving an additional sentence for subsequent convictions for other crimes, including racketeering and wiretapping. David Michael Hasselhoff , nicknamed \"The Hoff\", is an American actor, singer, producer, and businessman, who set a Guinness World Record as the most watched man on TV. Keith Ian Carradine is an American actor, singer and songwriter who has had success on stage, film and television. He is known for his roles as Tom Frank in Robert Altman's Nashville, Wild Bill Hickok in the HBO series Deadwood, FBI agent Frank Lundy in Dexter and US President Conrad Dalton in Madam Secretary. In addition, he is a Golden Globe- and Academy Award-winning songwriter. As a member of the Carradine family, he is part of an acting dynasty that began with his father, John Carradine. Sandra Will Carradine is an American film and television actress. She was formerly married to actor-singer-songwriter Keith Carradine, and around the time of their separation she became involved with Anthony Pellicano, a high-profile Hollywood private investigator who was involved in extensive illegal wiretapping activities. In 2006, she pleaded guilty to perjury for lying under oath about her awareness of Pellicano's wiretapping of Keith Carradine's phone. Arts, Briefly: Keith Carradine is suing Anthony Pellicano , the detective who was charged last month in the huge wiretapping scandal that has preoccupied Hollywood for months. In the complaint, filed Friday, Mr. Carradine contends that the detective conspired with Mr. Carradine 's ex-wife , Sandra Carradine , to eavesdrop on his conversations illegally. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order against the former'' Baywatch'' star David Hasselhoff , requiring him to stay at least 100 yards away from his estranged wife, Pamela Bach, according to court papers unsealed last week.

In her first term she introduced a bill to lend $20 million per year to small businesses and an amendment to assign liability to credit reporting agencies. She also contributed to legislation on executive pay. She was defeated in her November 2, 2010 re-election bid. Foley Case Snags Incumbent In Ohio Race for House Seat: But nowhere else has it become quite as pitched as here, where Ms. Kilroy -- who had already been trying to link Ms. Pryce to corruption scandals in Ohio involving Republicans -- has moved in with withering attacks since Mr. Foley resigned. In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Kilroy questioned whether Ms. Pryce had had any warning about Mr. Foley 's conduct, and why Ms. Pryce , the No. 4 Republican in the House, had not called for the resignation of Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois as speaker.'' Deborah Pryce, Mary Jo Kilroy\n",

After retiring from the Marine Corps, he began working as the chief military correspondent for The New York Times. He was subsequently a military analyst for NBC. With Michael Gordon, he was the author of three accounts of American wars in Iraq, The Generals War ; Cobra II ; and Endgame . Michael R. Gordon has been a national security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal since October 2017. Previously he was a military and diplomacy correspondent for The New York Times for 32 years. During the first phase of the Iraq War, he was the only newspaper reporter embedded with the allied land command under General Tommy Franks, a position that \"granted him unique access to cover the invasion strategy and its enactment\". He and General Bernard E. Trainor have written three books together, including the best-selling Cobra II. The Rumsfeld Doctrine: But with an administration where power is concentrated in the hands of a few, Gordon and Trainor 's focus on the military bureaucracy results in a somewhat constricted portrait of what actually took place. Indeed, Gordon and Trainor 's book suggests a conclusion they do n't draw: the initial impulse for war may have had little to do with Iraq itself. Bernard E. Trainor, Michael R. Gordon\n",

      "Iowa ) is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north. Kansas  is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita, with its most populated county being Johnson County. Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north; Missouri on the east; Oklahoma on the south; and Colorado on the west. Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks. The tribe's name is often said to mean \"people of the wind\" although this was probably not the term's original meaning. Ohio  is a Midwestern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Of the fifty states, it is the 34th largest by area, the seventh most populous, and the tenth most densely populated. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. Ohio is bordered by Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Lake Erie to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast. Virginia ), officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States located between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. LACKING PAPERS, CITIZENS ARE CUT FROM MEDICAID: A new federal rule intended to keep illegal immigrants from receiving Medicaid has instead shut out tens of thousands of United States citizens who have had difficulty complying with requirements to show birth certificates and other documents proving their citizenship, state officials say. Florida, Iowa , Kansas , Louisiana, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia have all reported declines in enrollment and traced them to the new federal requirement, which comes just as state officials around the country are striving to expand coverage through Medicaid and other means.

      "Lauren Slater is an American psychotherapist and writer. She is the author of nine books, including Welcome To My Country , Prozac Diary , and Lying: A Metaphorical Memoir . Her 2004 book Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century, a description of psychology experiments \"narrated as stories\", has drawn both praise and criticism. It was nominated for a Los Angeles Times Kirsch award for science and technology writing, and was named as a 2005 Bild Der Wissenschaft book of the year in Germany. Expecting Too Much From a Mind Drug: Her unfortunate and dated description of psychotropic medication as a'' chemical crutch'' belies what knowledgeable psychiatrists teach their patients: that medication is merely a bridge between feeling bad and feeling better; that the individual must still walk across that bridge; and that the waters below are still dangerous. Ronald Pies , M.D. Lexington, Mass., March 19, 2006 The writer is a clinical professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine. Lauren Slater, Ronald Pies\n",

Located along the Tigris River, the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the Islamic world. Iran, also called Persia, and officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. With 82 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 18th most populous country. Its territory spans 1,648,195 km2 , making it the second largest country in the Middle East and the 17th largest in the world. Iran is bordered to the northwest by Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, to the north by the Caspian Sea, to the northeast by Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. BUSH DECLARES IRAN'S ARMS ROLE IN IRAQ IS CERTAIN: Pres Bush says he is certain that factions within Iranian government supplied Shiites in Iraq with bombs that have killed American troops but does not know if Iran 's highest officials directed attacks. His most specific accusations to date reflect concerted effort to present clearer, more direct case on Iran 's role. Bush tells news conference that skepticism is` preposterous.' Asserts` with certainty' that Quds Force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards has provided sophisticated bombs and vows to protect troops. Defends sending more troops into Baghdad . Maj Gen William Caldwell, speaking in Baghdad , provides more detailed, on-the-record account of how administration believes explosively formed penetrators got to Iraq, although he is careful not to link Quds Force directly. Cites information from Iranians detained in Iraq recently. Bush also says what matters is that US is` responding,' not whether senior Iranian leaders are involved. Intense skepticism from Democrats and experts like David Kay, and charge that Bush uses Iran as scapegoat for Iraq failures, noted. Baghdad, Iran\n",

      "Context:\n",
      "Virgin America Inc. was an American airline that operated between 2007 and 2018, when it was integrated into Alaska Airlines. The airline primarily focused on operating low-fare service between cities on the West Coast and other major metropolitan areas, with higher quality service. It was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, and operated domestic flights to major U.S. cities, primarily from hubs at San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas. An American Version of Virgin Atlantic Is Tentatively Approved for Service: Virgin America , a proposed start-up airline backed by Richard Branson , won tentative approval to operate from the Transportation Department after agreeing to jettison its chief executive and revamp its financing to reduce the influence of Mr. Branson and other non-United States citizens. If Virgin America succeeds in starting operations this summer, as planned, it would add a major new player in the market for flights between the East Coast and West Coast, potentially pushing fares down and offering travelers more choices.

Dār is an Arabic word meaning \"home [of]\" – the region was named Dardaju while ruled by the Daju, who migrated from Meroë c. 350 AD, and it was then renamed Dartunjur when the Tunjur ruled the area. Darfur was an independent sultanate for several hundred years, incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916. Sudan or the Sudan , officially the Republic of the Sudan , is a country in Northeast Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Eritrea to the east, Ethiopia to the southeast, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. It has a population of 43 million people and occupies a total area of 1,886,068 square kilometres , making it the third-largest country in Africa. Sudanese Soldiers Flee War To Find a Limbo in Chad: The Sudanese government has vowed to crush the remaining rebel factions, and has forcefully rejected a Security Council resolution authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping force of more than 20,000 troops and police officers in Darfur to replace an overmatched and under-equipped African Union force. In August, Sudan made a counterproposal, saying it would use its own troops to quell the uprising. Darfur, Sudan\n",

Robert Moses was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban development in the United States. A Tale Of Two Cities: Co-op City, in the Bronx, was built on the site of the defunct Freedomland amusement park; Moses did not tear down tenements to make room for it. Correction: May 27, 2007, Sunday An article on May 6 about Robert Caro and his biography of Robert Moses referred imprecisely to Moses' role in Westway, a 1970s proposal for a superhighway and park development on the West Side of Manhattan.

He survived the Janowska concentration camp , the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp , the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, a death march to Chemnitz, Buchenwald, and the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp . I Have Never Forgotten You: Directed by Richard Trank Not rated; 105 minutes The legacy of the concentration camp survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal is one of unimpeachable bravery, but'' I Have Never Forgotten You,'' a new documentary, is a suspect monument to his courage. Directed by Richard Trank , also its co-author , the film effectively sketches Mr. Wiesenthal 's life, from his tenacity in surviving the genocide that claimed much of his family, to his determination to identify, find and punish ex-Nazis after World War II, at a time when many governments would have preferred to'' move on.''

Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the President of Russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 until 2008. In between his presidential terms, he was also the Prime Minister of Russia under president Dmitry Medvedev. Post-Putin: Announcing one 's own candidacy is, in fact, tantamount to declaring one 's open opposition to the Kremlin, to the smooth transition of power, to Putin himself . Even the parliamentary opposition is wary of doing that. So far in this quasi-election season only two people have done it: a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and, improbably, Aleksandr V. Donskoi , the youthful mayor of Arkhangelsk, a small port city on the White Sea. Both promptly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors, even as the mass media piled on in the way they never do with today 's authorities, certainly not the likes of Putin , Ivanov or Medvedev .

He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Clinton Camp Challenges Obama on Iraq: Yet when it came later to hypothetical questioning about how he would have voted on the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Mr. Obama has been more circumspect. With the war a central issue in the campaign and with part of Mr. Obama 's appeal among Democrats rooted in his opposition, his stance and the question of whether he has been consistent are likely to be themes throughout his battle for the Democratic nomination, especially if Mr. Obama uses his position to suggest that Mrs. Clinton and other candidates failed to be sufficiently skeptical of the Bush administration.

He was the younger brother of Bigga Haitian. Sean Bell was shot in the New York City borough of Queens, New York, United States, on November 25, 2006. Three men were shot when a total of 50 rounds were fired by a team of both plainclothes and undercover NYPD officers. Sean Bell was killed on the morning before his wedding, and two of his friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were severely wounded. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from members of the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Police Shooting Reunites Circle of Common Loss: In addition to his son, 13-year-old Nicholas Heyward Jr., who was playing with a toy gun when he was killed by a housing officer in Brooklyn, recent victims of violent encounters with the police included Amadou Diallo, killed in a hail of 41 bullets in the Bronx; Malcolm Ferguson, a drug suspect whose death came only five days after officers were acquitted in Mr. Diallo 's death; Gidone Busch, a mentally ill man killed by the police in Brooklyn; Patrick Dorismond , killed by an undercover narcotics detective in Manhattan; and Sean Bell , killed in Queens when five undercover detectives opened fire on his car. In the days before Mr. Bell 's funeral, the anguished club 's grapevine was in full operation: Mrs. Dorismond heard, but was not positive, that Mrs. Diallo, whose son was killed in 1999, would come from Maryland.

Timothy John Russert was an American television journalist and lawyer who appeared for more than 16 years as the longest-serving moderator of NBC's Meet the Press. He was a senior vice president at NBC News, Washington bureau chief and also hosted an eponymous CNBC/MSNBC weekend interview program. He was a frequent correspondent and guest on NBC's The Today Show and Hardball. Russert covered several presidential elections, and he presented the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey on the NBC Nightly News during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. IN CLOSING PLEAS, CLASHING VIEWS ON LIBBY'S ROLE: Defense and prosecution in perjury trial of former White House aide Lewis Libby make final summations. Prosecutors led by Patrick Fitzgerald review charge that Libby willfully lied to FBI agents and grand jury investigating leak of identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame in effort to discredit her husband Joseph Wilson, who debunked story that Iraq had tried to buy uranium in Niger. Theodore Wells argues tearfully that any inaccuracies were innocent memory lapses explained by Libby 's pressing schedule as Vice Pres Cheney 's chief of staff. Fitzgerald says disclosure left cloud over White House and Cheney because he was behind effort and that Libby decided to lie rather than risk being prosecuted for leaking agent 's name. Wells disparages newsman Tim Russert 's credibility in saying he did not reveal name to Libby because he did not know it until he read Robert Novak 's column on July 14, 2003. Patrick J.

Jonathan Mallamud says he does not see harm in Gordon expressing his personal opinion outside newspaper. Rod Goodwin strongly disagrees with Calame. Mark Regan says Gordon 's status as author and analyst qualifies him to state opinions during television appearances. T R Reid says if Gordon has an opinion on war it is better for readers to know what it is. Harry Allan, Michael Gordon\n",

Central Asians Chase Jobs, and Endure Exploitation: Whether exploited or not, thousands of workers are abandoning southern Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan every week for jobs on building sites and road paving crews, on churning factory lines and in market stalls across Kazakhstan and Russia, with potentially rippling consequences for a politically unstable region that has seen sporadic ethnic clashes in recent months. Migrant workers from Central Asia make a significant economic contribution to the region 's stability by sending money back home, yet the thickening flow of migrants in a region of ethnic tensions has contributed to a general unease.

Sudanese Soldiers Flee War To Find a Limbo in Chad: The Sudanese government has vowed to crush the remaining rebel factions, and has forcefully rejected a Security Council resolution authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping force of more than 20,000 troops and police officers in Darfur to replace an overmatched and under-equipped African Union force. In August, Sudan made a counterproposal, saying it would use its own troops to quell the uprising. Darfur, Sudan\n",

Her external assignment at the Foundation for the Future, a \"semi-independent foundation to promote democracy\" is both in the Middle East and in North Africa. Committee Is Likely to Say Wolfowitz Broke the Rules: Mr. Wolfowitz 's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said he hoped that the board would acknowledge that whatever happened, the bank president had sincerely tried to do the right thing and arranged for the pay increase only after consulting widely. Mr. Bennett also said he would submit a detailed rebuttal of the recollections of two top officials who testified to the special committee this week that, contrary to Mr. Wolfowitz 's recollection, they had not approved all aspects of Ms. Riza 's compensation arrangements.''

Post-Putin: Announcing one 's own candidacy is, in fact, tantamount to declaring one 's open opposition to the Kremlin, to the smooth transition of power, to Putin himself . Even the parliamentary opposition is wary of doing that. So far in this quasi-election season only two people have done it: a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and, improbably, Aleksandr V. Donskoi , the youthful mayor of Arkhangelsk, a small port city on the White Sea. Both promptly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors, even as the mass media piled on in the way they never do with today 's authorities, certainly not the likes of Putin , Ivanov or Medvedev .

      "William Jefferson Clinton is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Prior to the presidency, he was the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992, and the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was ideologically a New Democrat, and many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. Joseph Isadore Lieberman is an American politician, lobbyist and attorney who served as a United States Senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. A former member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 election. During his final term in office he was officially listed as an independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party. Edward Miner Lamont Jr. is an American businessman and politician serving as the 89th governor of Connecticut since January 9, 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a Greenwich selectman from 1987 to 1989. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006, defeating incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman in the state Democratic primary election. Lamont Criticizes Lieberman's 1998 Rebuke of Clinton Over Affair: Senator Lieberman said what he believed. And many people believe that by making the statement he did, and separating the moral ramifications from any legal questions he helped defuse the case for impeachment to protect President Clinton 's presidency.'' As the two Senate candidates returned to Connecticut from Washington on Thursday, Mr. Lamont unveiled a new campaign commercial featuring a young man reading the names of several soldiers who were killed in the war in Iraq.

      "Barack Hussein Obama II ; born August 4, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer and public speaker. She was First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election. Clinton Camp Challenges Obama on Iraq: Yet when it came later to hypothetical questioning about how he would have voted on the 2002 Iraq war resolution, Mr. Obama has been more circumspect. With the war a central issue in the campaign and with part of Mr. Obama 's appeal among Democrats rooted in his opposition, his stance and the question of whether he has been consistent are likely to be themes throughout his battle for the Democratic nomination, especially if Mr. Obama uses his position to suggest that Mrs. Clinton and other candidates failed to be sufficiently skeptical of the Bush administration.

First elected to Congress in 1987, Pelosi is the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history. Speaker Pelosi Tempts Disaster: As incoming speaker, Ms. Pelosi will be dogged by skepticism -- from within the party and without -- about her political smarts and her ability to deliver a galvanized agenda. It was a no-brainer for the caucus to end the misguided fight for Mr. Murtha , who belittled the need for reform. John P. Murtha, Nancy Pelosi\n",

However, Tasini later decided to run instead for a seat in the House of Representatives in 2010. Phil Arnold was an American screen, stage, television, and vaudeville actor. He appeared in approximately 150 films and television shows between 1939 and 1968. Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Republican Candidate Points To Clinton's Opponent: Mr. Arnold included a link to Mr. Tasini 's Web site and suggested that Spencer supporters pass it along. Mrs. Clinton voted to authorize military action in Iraq and has said that troops should not be withdrawn in haste, but she has also been critical of the execution of the war and recently called for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jonathan Tasini, Phil Arnold\n",

      "Patrick J. Fitzgerald is an American lawyer and partner at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom since October 2012.For more than a decade, until June 30, 2012, Fitzgerald was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Timothy John Russert was an American television journalist and lawyer who appeared for more than 16 years as the longest-serving moderator of NBC's Meet the Press. He was a senior vice president at NBC News, Washington bureau chief and also hosted an eponymous CNBC/MSNBC weekend interview program. He was a frequent correspondent and guest on NBC's The Today Show and Hardball. Russert covered several presidential elections, and he presented the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey on the NBC Nightly News during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. IN CLOSING PLEAS, CLASHING VIEWS ON LIBBY'S ROLE: Defense and prosecution in perjury trial of former White House aide Lewis Libby make final summations. Prosecutors led by Patrick Fitzgerald review charge that Libby willfully lied to FBI agents and grand jury investigating leak of identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame in effort to discredit her husband Joseph Wilson, who debunked story that Iraq had tried to buy uranium in Niger. Theodore Wells argues tearfully that any inaccuracies were innocent memory lapses explained by Libby 's pressing schedule as Vice Pres Cheney 's chief of staff. Fitzgerald says disclosure left cloud over White House and Cheney because he was behind effort and that Libby decided to lie rather than risk being prosecuted for leaking agent 's name. Wells disparages newsman Tim Russert 's credibility in saying he did not reveal name to Libby because he did not know it until he read Robert Novak 's column on July 14, 2003. Patrick J.

Secret to Mickelson's Success: Going Back to Drawing Board: The threesome -- as they have now done on three occasions -- created a strategy that helped Mickelson win a major championship, a two-shot victory Sunday at the Masters that seemed to portend more of the same.'' I could n't have done this by myself,'' Mickelson said after winning his second green jacket.'' To have the help from Dave Pelz and Rick Smith , it has really given me the guidance.

      "Eliot Laurence Spitzer is an American politician, attorney, and educator. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 54th Governor of New York. Joseph Louis Bruno is an American businessman and Republican politician from upstate New York. Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Sheldon Silver is a former lawyer, Democratic Party politician from New York City and convicted felon who served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1994 until 2015. The Reform Window: His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O'Connell, the Republican, is government reform. Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer , Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce'' sweeping reforms'' of the way the state budget is put together. Eliot Spitzer, Joseph L. Bruno, Sheldon Silver\n",

      "Christopher L. Jacobs is a New York State Senator for the 60th district and former Secretary of State of New York. Until December 31, 2016, he was the County Clerk of Erie County, New York. In May 2019, Jacobs announced that he was running for New York's 27th congressional district in the 2020 elections. John James Faso Jr.  is an American attorney and politician who served as the U.S. Representative for New York's 19th congressional district from 2017 to 2019. Faso was first elected to the post in 2016. A Republican, Faso previously represented the 102nd district in the New York State Assembly from 1987 to 2002 and served as Assembly Minority Leader from 1998 to 2002. Faso ran for New York State Comptroller in 2002 and for Governor of New York in 2006, but did not prevail in either race. William Floyd Weld is an American attorney, businessman, author, and Republican politician who served as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997. Weld is currently running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2020. Republican Says Weld Will Name Secretary of State as His Running Mate: In April, Gov. George E. Pataki named Mr. Jacobs to replace Randy A. Daniels as secretary of state . He was confirmed by the Senate this month, but it is unlikely that he will retain that job after Mr. Pataki leaves office at the end of the year. Last week, Mr. Weld 's opponent , John Faso , a former state assemblyman , chose C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, as his running mate. Christopher L. Jacobs, John J.

Bruno served in the New York State Senate from 1977 to 2008, and was Senate Majority Leader from 1994 to 2008. Bruno was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2009, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and a subsequent retrial resulted in an acquittal. Kevin Sheekey is an American businessman and political adviser. He is the Global Head of Communications, Government Relations and Marketing for Bloomberg L.P. He previously served as head of government relations and communications at Bloomberg L.P. and as chairman of Bloomberg Government. Sheekey also previously served as deputy mayor for government affairs for the City of New York under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He is credited with managing Mayor Bloomberg's three successful campaigns for Mayor of New York. Michael Rubens Bloomberg KBE is an American businessman, politician, author, and philanthropist. As of October 2019, his net worth was estimated at $51.1 billion, making him the 12th richest person in the United States and the 17th richest person in the world. He has joined The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Strategist With Sharp Elbows Has Bloomberg Swinging Away: Kevin Sheekey , Mayor Michael R Bloomberg 's top political strategist and deputy mayor for intergovernmental relations, has gone on virtual war footing to make sure Bloomberg pushes through his agenda before he is forced to leave office in 2009 by term limits. Several officials upstate and downstate say they are watching to see whether Bloomberg benefits from his new aggressiveness or whether it backfires to damage city 's relations with its partners in government. Joseph L Bruno , Senate majority leader , has expressed displeasure with new tone from City Hall, but Sheekey is unbowed. Joseph L. Bruno, Kevin Sheekey, Michael R. Bloomberg\n",

A Vision in the Desert: Mr. Nouvel also envisions the art spilling out onto the alleyways and courtyards, from sculpture to mosaics. Mr. Gehry 's Guggenheim, planned for a choice site at the tip of the island, is also conceived as a series of galleries loosely arranged around open-air courtyards, a bit like a souk.

A decision by the judge may come as soon as today on the suit, which argues that Mr. Brown took the'' thematic architecture'' of his novel from the 1982 nonfiction book'' The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' written by Mr. Baigent with Richard Leigh , a co-plaintiff, and Henry Lincoln.

He has been cited as the most powerful vice president in American history. He was also one of the most unpopular politicians in the history of the US, holding an approval rating of just 13% at the time of leaving office.Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Casper, Wyoming. He attended Yale and then the University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. Syed Pervez Musharraf is a Pakistani politician and retired four-star general of the Pakistan Army, who was the 10th President of Pakistan from 2001 until tendering his resignation, to avoid impeachment, in 2008.Born in Delhi during the British Raj, Musharraf was raised in Karachi and Istanbul. He went on to study mathematics at the Forman Christian College in Lahore and would later study at the Royal College of Defence Studies in 1991. Cheney Denies Aiming to 'Beat Up On' Musharraf: The idea that I 'd go in and threaten someone is an invalid misreading of the way I do business.'' As Mr. Cheney traveled to Pakistan, senior administration officials said his talking points for a meeting with Mr. Musharraf included a strong warning that the Democrats in Congress were threatening to reduce Pakistan 's foreign aid if it failed to combat terrorism.

Sir Tom Stoppard  is a Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter.

He co-wrote the screenplays for Brazil, The Russia House, and Shakespeare in Love, and has received an Academy Award and four Tony Awards. History's Sweep, In Words And Silence: That 's Mr. Stoppard 's sublimely theatrical way of admitting that words, his beloved stock in trade, ultimately do n't count for much in the course of human events. Many of his characters come to the same conclusion in'' Shipwreck,'' which is directed by Jack O'Brien with the same seductive vividness he brought to the trilogy 's first part,'' Voyage,'' which opened last month .

Edwards is known for the 1978 \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", where he recovered a fumble by Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik, for a touchdown during the waning seconds of a certain Eagles loss, to turn it into a victory. Robert Terrence \"Terry\" Bradway is an American football executive. He served as the general manager for the New York Jets of the National Football League from 2001 to 2006. Bradway worked in the personnel department for the Kansas City Chiefs prior to being hired as general manager of the Jets. In His Silence, Bradway Seems To Drop Hint: Because public speaking does not appear to be one of Bradway 's favorite things, he was happy to cede the spotlight over the last five years to Edwards, who became, by default, the face and voice of the organization.''

The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from members of the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Testimony To Be Heard On Shooting By the Police: Mr. Hardy, lawyers representing some of the five officers involved in the shooting and others said they expected the grand jury 's work would last at least three weeks. The two men wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting , Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman , intend to testify, said Mr. Hardy, and will most likely do so toward the end of the grand jury process.''

Police Chief Places Blame For Deaths of Two Officers: The chief of the Jersey City Police Department blamed state transportation officials on Friday for the deaths of two officers who drove off an open vertical lift bridge, saying that the bridge was in chronic disrepair and that the operators compounded the danger by failing to tell the officers exactly when the deck was going to be raised. Chief Robert A. Troy delivered a minute-by-minute report of the Christmas night accident, from the first businesslike call that the bridge needed to be lifted for a passing tugboat to the final grief-streaked radio transmissions made seconds after Officers Shawn Carson and Robert Nguyen plunged into the frigid waters of the Hackensack River.''

      "Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías ; 28 July 1954 – 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who was president of Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela , which he led until 2012. Manuel J. Rosales, Jr., is an American organ builder whose instruments display a strong synthesis of romantic and contemporary styles. His workshop has built over 30 pipe organs with his notable output including collaborations on the instruments at Walt Disney Concert Hall and Rice University. Venezuela Groups Get U.S. Aid Amid Meddling Charges: He echoed recent comments from other high-ranking officials and from Mr. Chávez , who has a double-digit lead in most polls over his main opponent , Manuel Rosales , the governor of Zulia State . Mr. Chávez rarely refers in public to Mr. Rosales by name, instead framing his campaign as a choice between his government and the Bush administration. Hugo Chavez, Manuel J. Rosales\n",

      "Virgin America Inc. was an American airline that operated between 2007 and 2018, when it was integrated into Alaska Airlines. The airline primarily focused on operating low-fare service between cities on the West Coast and other major metropolitan areas, with higher quality service. It was headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Burlingame, and operated domestic flights to major U.S. cities, primarily from hubs at San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as a smaller focus city operation at Love Field in Dallas. An American Version of Virgin Atlantic Is Tentatively Approved for Service: Virgin America , a proposed start-up airline backed by Richard Branson , won tentative approval to operate from the Transportation Department after agreeing to jettison its chief executive and revamp its financing to reduce the influence of Mr. Branson and other non-United States citizens. If Virgin America succeeds in starting operations this summer, as planned, it would add a major new player in the market for flights between the East Coast and West Coast, potentially pushing fares down and offering travelers more choices.

      "Majid Jahangir Khan is a former cricketer, batsman and captain of the Pakistan cricket team. In his prime, Majid Khan was considered one of the best batsmen in the world, able to decimate any bowling attack, including the mighty West Indian fast bowlers of that era. In an 18-year Test career, he only played in 63 Test matches, primarily because Pakistan played a very limited Test match schedule. Khan's first-class career spanned 1961 to 1985. Uzair Paracha is a Pakistani American convicted of providing material support to al-Qaeda by a court in New York City in 2005. He received a 30-year prison sentence which was later voided. Pakistani Gets 30 Years for Aiding Qaeda Operative: According to trial testimony and Justice Department documents, Mr. Khan had planned with top Qaeda leaders in Pakistan to bomb underground storage tanks at gas stations in Maryland. Mr. Paracha impersonated Mr. Khan , including posing as him during telephone calls with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and using his credit card to make it appear as though Mr. Khan had never left the United States, when in fact he had gone to Pakistan without notifying immigration authorities. Majid Khan, Uzair Paracha\n",

The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.

      "London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits. The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status. The City of New York, usually called either New York City or simply New York , is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles , New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York Isn't the World's Undisputed Financial Capital: Over the last five years, London 's upscale restaurant offering has grown, largely as a result of the strength'' of the financial district, said Iqbal Wahhab, the owner of Roast, a new restaurant, which uses only ingredients from Britain and features dishes like herring roe on toast. In perhaps another sign of London 's ascendancy, Mr. Wahhab said he was seriously considering expanding Roast -- to New York . London, New York City\n",

      "Simon Wiesenthal was a Jewish Austrian Holocaust survivor, Nazi hunter, and writer. He studied architecture and was living in Lwów at the outbreak of World War II. He survived the Janowska concentration camp , the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp , the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, a death march to Chemnitz, Buchenwald, and the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp . I Have Never Forgotten You: Directed by Richard Trank Not rated; 105 minutes The legacy of the concentration camp survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal is one of unimpeachable bravery, but'' I Have Never Forgotten You,'' a new documentary, is a suspect monument to his courage. Directed by Richard Trank , also its co-author , the film effectively sketches Mr. Wiesenthal 's life, from his tenacity in surviving the genocide that claimed much of his family, to his determination to identify, find and punish ex-Nazis after World War II, at a time when many governments would have preferred to'' move on.''

He is nicknamed Il Cavaliere for his Order of Merit for Labour, although he voluntarily resigned from this order in March 2014. A Look at Italian Politics, A Peek at American Films: Beguiled by an attractive young screenwriter (Jasmine Trinca), Bruno decides to make an anti-Berlusconi picture (also called'' The Caiman ,'' which is more or less a synonym for crocodile), and encounters various obstacles, ranging from the skepticism of financiers and the unreliability of actors to his own temperamental befuddlement. After all, he admits at one point, he was a Berlusconi voter. Nanni Moretti, Silvio Berlusconi\n",

      "Robert Allan Caro is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of United States political figures Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson. Robert Moses was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban development in the United States. A Tale Of Two Cities: Co-op City, in the Bronx, was built on the site of the defunct Freedomland amusement park; Moses did not tear down tenements to make room for it. Correction: May 27, 2007, Sunday An article on May 6 about Robert Caro and his biography of Robert Moses referred imprecisely to Moses' role in Westway, a 1970s proposal for a superhighway and park development on the West Side of Manhattan.

It borders Guinea and Liberia to the west, Burkina Faso and Mali to the north, Ghana to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. Ivory Coast Leader Signs Accord With Rebels: Civil war broke out in Ivory Coast in September 2002 after a long period of upheaval and economic decline that followed the death of its first leader, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, in 1993. The causes of the conflict were complex, rooted largely in the tension between the predominantly Muslim north, where many people are descendants of immigrants from neighboring countries like Burkina Faso and Mali, and the largely Christian and animist ethnic people of the south, some of whom claim to be the true Ivorians.

Russia Considers Alternatives to the Oil Pipeline Through Belarus: With the new year, Russia began charging Belarus $ 100 per thousand cubic meters of gas, more than double the old rate of$ 46. It also imposed a duty of$ 180 a ton on oil that officials said Belarus was obtaining at subsidized rates and reselling on world markets. In response, Belarus imposed a transshipment fee of$ 45 a ton on oil going through Belarus in the Druzhba pipeline to Europe . On Monday, officials in Moscow accused Belarus of siphoning off about 79,000 tons -- roughly half a million barrels -- of Russian oil bound for Europe , then shut down the pipeline entirely. Normally the 2,500-mile pipeline pumps 1.2 million barrels a day to Eastern and Central Europe , with one arm running to Poland and Germany and the other to Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic .

Nuclear Panel Votes to Report Tehran to U.N.: The final resolution included a clause stating that'' a solution to the Iranian issue would contribute to global nonproliferation efforts and to realizing the objective of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, including their means of delivery.'' The vote on Saturday was particularly important because it had the backing of Russia and China, which had abstained in the last resolution on Iran last September. Iran, Russia\n",

Russia Considers Alternatives to the Oil Pipeline Through Belarus: With the new year, Russia began charging Belarus $ 100 per thousand cubic meters of gas, more than double the old rate of$ 46. It also imposed a duty of$ 180 a ton on oil that officials said Belarus was obtaining at subsidized rates and reselling on world markets. In response, Belarus imposed a transshipment fee of$ 45 a ton on oil going through Belarus in the Druzhba pipeline to Europe. On Monday, officials in Moscow accused Belarus of siphoning off about 79,000 tons -- roughly half a million barrels -- of Russian oil bound for Europe, then shut down the pipeline entirely. Normally the 2,500-mile pipeline pumps 1.2 million barrels a day to Eastern and Central Europe, with one arm running to Poland and Germany and the other to Ukraine , Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic .

Iran is bordered to the northwest by Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, to the north by the Caspian Sea, to the northeast by Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Israel , also known as the State of Israel , is a country in Western Asia, located on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. In New Middle East, Tests for an Old Friendship: That has pleased many of Israel 's supporters, including those among an increasingly vocal, fiercely pro-Israel community of evangelicals, who visited the White House at least once during the Lebanon war to voice support for allowing the air attacks on Hezbollah to continue unabated.

U.S. PAYS PAKISTAN TO FIGHT TERROR, BUT PATROLS EBB: The United States is continuing to make large payments of roughly$ 1 billion a year to Pakistan for what it calls reimbursements to the country 's military for conducting counterterrorism efforts along the border with Afghanistan, even though Pakistan 's president decided eight months ago to slash patrols through the area where Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are most active. The monthly payments, called coalition support funds, are not widely advertised. Pakistan, United States\n",

      "Iraq or ; Arabic: العراق‎ al-'Irāq; Kurdish: عێراق‎ Êraq), officially the Republic of Iraq , is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups including Arabs, Kurds, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians and Kawliya. Syria , officially the Syrian Arab Republic , is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon to the southwest, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, Syria is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Syrian Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Circassians, Mandeans and Turkemens. The Real Fumble in Damascus: There is at least one point on which we and the critics of Nancy Pelosi 's visit to Damascus can agree: It is the White House, not the speaker of the House, that should be taking the diplomatic lead. But the Bush administration has far more appetite for scoring political points than figuring out whether talking to Syria might help contain the bloodletting in Iraq or revive efforts to negotiate peace.
